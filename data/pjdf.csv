Synaptic plasticity requires the exquisite temporal and spatial regulation of protein synthesis to ensure efficacious synaptic remodeling. Products of mutated genes in syndromic forms of autism point to a relationship between disrupted synaptic function and dysregulated protein metabolism. Our research on FXS in both rodent models and humans addresses our central hypothesis that dysregulated protein metabolism in the nervous system can lead to the development of autism and/or intellectual disability in humans. FXS is the most common inherited form of intellectual disability in males with an estimated frequency of 1/4000. FXS is also the most common known cause of autism. Expansion of a CGG repeat sequence in the fragile X mental retardation gene (FMR1) on the X chromosome is the usual cause of FXS. Normally the CGG repeat sequence has 4-54 repeats. Individuals with repeat lengths of 55-200 have the fragile X premutation and are carriers of FXS. In this range the repeat is unstable and tends to expand in succeeding generations. When the sequence length expands to greater than 200 repeats, FMR1 is silenced, and its protein product, fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), is absent resulting in FXS. Besides moderate to severe intellectual disability, FXS is characterized by enlarged testicles, elongated face, immature-appearing dendritic spines, hyperactivity, anxiety, increased sensory sensitivity, autistic behavior, and seizures. The basis of our current work is our finding in a knockout mouse model (Fmr1 KO) of FXS that regional rates of cerebral protein synthesis (rCPS) are increased, particularly in hippocampus, thalamus, and hypothalamus (Qin M et al. J Neurosci 25:5087, 2005). This finding is consistent with the proposed role of FMRP as a suppressor of translation and our hypothesis that a dysregulation of brain protein metabolism is a core phenotype in FXS. We have developed a quantitative autoradiographic method for measurement of rCPS in vivo, and we have adapted the method for use with positron emission tomography (PET) so that measurements can now also be made in humans. Our ability to measure rCPS in man may endow us with a marker of the disease and a means to measure the efficacy of proposed treatments in patients. Measurement of rCPS may provide a tool in the field: a means of assessing disease progress and potential treatment efficacy that is objective and quantitative. Based on results of our studies in the Fmr1 KO mouse, we proposed that changes in rCPS are a core phenotype of FXS and that in humans  we would find an increased rCPS in selective regions of the brain. Most participants with FXS are unable to undergo the PET study procedures awake, so we have used sedation to help them to remain motionless during PET studies. In our initial study we used propofol for sedation. In healthy volunteers, propofol sedation had no effect on rCPS, but in patients with FXS studied under propofol-sedation we found statistically significant reductions in rCPS compared with sedated controls. A subsequent study in the Fmr1 KO mouse model indicated that propofol had very little effect on rCPS in wild type (WT) animals, but in Fmr1 KO mice propofol decreased rCPS significantly throughout the brain (Qin et al., J. Cerebr Blood Flow & Metab, 2013). We continue to address the question of rCPS in individuals with FXS by studying participants with a different sedative and, in a few cases, studying them awake with a modified protocol. In accord with our hypothesis that a dysregulation of protein synthesis is a core phenotype in FXS, we continue to look for potential treatments that will alter the behavioral and rCPS phenotypes in the Fmr1 KO mouse model.","The work on humans was conducted under the protocol 06-M-0214, NCT00362843.   During the 2021 funding period, we addressed the following:1) rCPS measured with the L-1-C-11leucine PET method in participants with FXS and healthy volunteers studied under dexmedetomidine sedation, 2) rCPS measured with the L-1-C-11leucine PET method in participants with FXS and healthy volunteers studied in the awake state, 3) protein synthesis rates in mouse models of other neurodevelopmental disorders, 4) mTORC1 activity as a central regulator of brain protein synthesis in some neurodevelopmental disorders, 5) sleep and neurodevelopmental disorders, 6) effects of treatment of Fmr1 KO mice with a phosphodiesterase D inhibitor on behavior and rCPS.1) Measurement of rCPS in humans with fragile X syndrome studied under sedation.  All subjects were males between the ages of 18 and 24 years and free of psychotropic medication.  As most fragile X participants were not able to undergo the PET study awake, we used dexmedetomidine for sedation during the imaging studies.  We found no differences between rCPS measured during dexmedetomidine-sedation and the awake state in ten healthy controls.  In the comparison of rCPS in dexmedetomidine-sedated fragile X participants (n=9) and healthy controls (n=14) we found no statistically significant differences.  Our results from in vivo measurements in human brain do not support the hypothesis that rCPS are elevated due to the absence of FMRP.  This hypothesis is based on findings in animal models and in vitro measurements in human peripheral cells. The absence of a translation suppressor (FMRP) may produce a more complex response in pathways regulating translation than previously thought.   Results of this study were published in Neurobiology of Disease. 2) Measurement of rCPS in humans with fragile X syndrome. We used the L-1-C-11leucine PET method to measure rCPS. We have focused our efforts on trying to study individuals with fragile X syndrome without the use of sedatives. We used our modified and validated PET protocol to enable some fragile X participants to undergo the study awake. We compared rCPS in 10 fragile X participants and 16 age-matched controls all in the awake state with the same procedure.  Contrary to the prevailing hypothesis and findings in Fmr1 knockout mice, results indicate that rCPS in awake fragile X subjects are decreased in whole brain and most brain regions by 13-21% compared to healthy controls.3) The genetic bases of several other neurodevelopmental disorders suggest that defects in translational control may be a core phenotype. For example, tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is caused by heterozygous mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 gene, both of which encode proteins that are negative regulators of mTOR activity. The mTOR pathway is one of the nodes regulating protein synthesis. Disruption of this control is thought to underlie some of the phenotypes observed in TSC. We have measured rCPS in a mouse model of TSC, TSC2+/-, and found that rCPS are decreased throughout the brain. We continue studies of rCPS in mouse models of other neurodevelopmental disorders such as Shank3 KO mice. SHANK3 is a postsynaptic scaffolding protein that plays a critical role in synaptic development and brain function.  Mutations in SHANK3 are implicated in Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS), a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by autistic-like behavior, delayed speech, hypotonia, and intellectual disability (ID).  Moreover, mutations in SHANK3 occur in 1-2% of cases of idiopathic autism spectrum disorder (ASD).  In fragile X syndrome (FXS), a syndromic form of autism, SHANK3 is one of the 842 targets of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), the protein product of the silenced FMR1 gene.  FXS is likely a primary disorder of the regulation of translation, whereas other syndromic forms of ASD/ID, e.g., PMS, appear to be primary disorders of synaptic structure.  In this study, we asked if a knockout of the synaptic protein, Shank3, is linked to an effect on translation.  Specifically, we measured the effect of Shank3 loss on rates of cerebral protein synthesis (rCPS) in vivo by means of the L-1-14Cleucine quantitative autoradiographic method.  We found that Shank3 knockout mice had significantly increased rCPS in every brain region examined.  Our results suggest a link in ASD/ID between synaptic structure and regulation of translation.4) It has been reported that the mTOR pathway is overactivated in Fmr1 KO mice. We are investigating the consequences of increased mTORC1 activation in Fmr1 KO mice. We treated Fmr1 KO mice chronically with an mTORC1 inhibitor, rapamycin, to determine if rapamycin treatment could reverse behavioral phenotypes. We found that pS6 was upregulated in Fmr1 KO mice and normalized by rapamycin treatment, but, except for an anxiogenic effect, rapamycin did not reverse any of the behavioral phenotypes examined. Moreover, rapamycin treatment had an adverse effect on sleep and social behavior in both control and Fmr1 KO mice. Studies of rCPS in rapamycin-treated Fmr1 KO mice are ongoing. We are measuring rCPS in vivo in these mice.5) Sleep and neurodevelopmental disorders. Sleep abnormalities are one of the most prevalent concurrent disorders in patients diagnosed with neurodevelopmental syndromes. In these patients, the severity of behavioral abnormalities and the severity of sleep abnormalities are correlated. Given the importance of sleep in developmental plasticity, we continue studies on the role of sleep in neurodevelopmental disorders. We are collecting sleep data on numerous mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders including Shank3 KO, Oxytocin receptor KO, and Tsc2+/- mice. Additionally, we are treating Fmr1 KO mice with hypnotics to determine the effects on sleep and other behavioral phenotypes.6) Studies in humans, mice and Drosophila indicate that a deficit of FMRP in FXS influences cAMP levels. Our study investigated the possibility that targeting cAMP levels may have therapeutic value in FXS. We assessed the therapeutic and neurochemical effects of chronic administration of the phosphodiesterase-4D negative allosteric modulator, BPN14770, in Fmr1 KO mice. BPN14770 treatment had limited effects on the behavioral phenotype in Fmr1 KO mice. Some effects such as increased sleep duration and increased social behavior occurred in both genotypes. In the open field, the hyperactivity response in Fmr1 KO mice was ameliorated by BPN14770 treatment at low and intermediate doses.  BPN14770 treatment tended to increase rCPS in a dose-dependent manner in WT mice, whereas in Fmr1 KO mice effects on rCPS were less apparent.  Results indicate BPN14770 treatment improves some behavior in Fmr1 KO mice.  Results also suggest a genotype difference in the regulation of translation via a cAMP-dependent pathway. Results of this study were published in Neurobiology of Disease.","Ordered by reference within the summary, then by publication type and author name.

Such stressors, especially when chronic, produce cellular changes in brain regions processing emotional content, contributing to altered affective behavior that underlies psychiatric mood disorders. Both sustained psychological stressors and related physiological challenges affect the brain directly and indirectly via interactions between the brain and the peripheral cardiovascular, endocrine, and immune systems with which the brain is interconnected via neural and hormonal communication routes. Psychological stressors alter activity within peripheral systems, and the alterations in those systems in turn feed back onto the brain to alter brain activity, notably in circuits subserving affective behavior. The research in our lab focuses on key components of the interaction between the brain and the periphery in mice undergoing psychosocial stress imposed in ethologically relevant paradigms. Our goal is to identify the key cellular and molecular players that are engaged in this bi-directional dialog between the brain and the periphery when an animal responds to acute and chronic stress. Key players are the brains immune cells, i.e., microglia and barrier-associated macrophages, peripheral leukocytes, and components of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), including meninges, endothelial cells, and other cells comprising the neurovascular unit (NVU). Behavioral, histochemical, biochemical, and molecular tools are employed to identify and characterize the responsive cells and molecules. The work identifies pathways and mechanisms by which peripheral signaling impacts the brain. Understanding the cellular and molecular factors differentially controlling the outcomes in question may help guide development of interventions aimed at treating mental disorders, notably depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress that arise because of psychosocial, pathophysiological, and immunological challenges.","Chronic psychosocial stress has been implicated in the etiology and progression of psychiatric disorders such as major depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We study the effects of psychosocial stress in a chronic social defeat (CSD) paradigm in mice that generates behavioral alterations manifested as social avoidance, anhedonia, anxiety, and depressive-like states. In CSD, two male mice are placed in a continuous dyadic living relationship in which the subordinate experimental mouse is chronically exposed to and periodically briefly defeated by a dominant mouse of a different strain. Over the course of weeks in this living situation, the experimental mouse develops asocial, anhedonic, and anxious behaviors that can be experimentally linked with neurochemical and physical alterations in identified stress-related, limbic brain circuits. For example, our past research showed that animals undergoing CSD have reduced hippocampal new-cell proliferation and reduced medial prefrontal cortical myelination. These kinds of changes have been associated with anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors in animal and human studies. Thus, the paradigm allows us to examine mechanistic bases for mental illness in humans.We hypothesize that there is a bi-directional dialog between the brain and the periphery that serves to maintain homeostasis in healthy states, but disturbances within this dialog lead to homeostatic deviations that contribute to the onset and course of psychiatric disease. Peripheral interactions with the brain can occur at the blood-brain barrier (BBB).  CSD can result in compromise to the integrity of the BBB.  Immune cells that normally reside at the BBB alter their composition and activity during CSD.  We examine these changes using histochemical, cellular, and molecular techniques.  One project focuses on vascular and microglial changes in rodents undergoing CSD stress. A second project focuses on the role of the peripheral immune system in maintaining homeostatic balance during CSD.1) Stressful events engage the periphery via well-characterized activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and by activity within the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Thus, hormonal and neural activity affects all peripheral organs, and these organs, in turn, generate neuronal, cellular, and chemical signals that can reach the brain to adjust the homeostatic balance in response to challenges. Many of these signals must first encounter the BBB, which largely excludes blood-borne signals generated by the peripheral organs. However, numerous bypass mechanisms have evolved to permit information transfer into the brain. Furthermore, the BBB at a cellular level is highly dynamic, and transient breeches can occur under certain circumstances. We were surprised to discover that animals susceptible to CSD (called CSD-S mice), i.e., mice that showed asocial and anxiety-like behaviors, had microglial gene expression changes that suggested breakdown of the extracellular matrix, phagocytic activity, and BBB extravasation. To investigate this further, we used histochemical methods to discover that indeed, CSD-S animals showed scattered, rare microhemorrhages throughout the brain. These small BBB breaches allowed blood products to gain access to perivascular spaces and the brain parenchyma. At the level of the blood vessel, the main constituent of the BBB is the vascular brain endothelial cell, so we endeavored to characterize the response of these cells to CSD. Microarray transcriptomics analysis revealed that CSD induced in endothelial cells a dynamic temporal pattern of gene activation reflecting the biological process of wounding and repair. In current experiments, the recovery period following the cessation of CSD is being examined. We have found that peripheral monocytes, which are not involved in the CSD and therefore do not accumulate in the 14-day period of CSD, do accumulate at perivascular areas during a two-week recovery period.  Here, they phagocytose fibrinogen, an inflammatory blood product.  They also appear to participate in vascular repair and behavioral recovery in this period. Elimination of the peripheral monocyte population hinders fibrinogen clearance and recovery from CSD-induced behavioral deficits in the urine scent marking (USM) task.The appearance of scattered microbleeds during CSD suggested that stress causes changes in cardiovascular function in the form of elevated blood pressure and/or heart rate.  Mice were equipped with transponders, and these parameters were tracked during the defeat sessions.  Dramatic biphasic drops and elevations in blood pressure were observed, and they did not habituate over the course of the CSD session.  Because environmental enrichment (EE) was previously shown by us to protect against the deleterious effects of chronic stress, we employed it again and found that EE also protected against the blood pressure drops and surges.  Anti-hypertensive drug administration also offered protection.2) We conduct experiments aimed at addressing the role of the peripheral immune system in controlling affective behaviors in chronic psychological stress. We are particularly interested leukocyte cell types that may contribute to altered mood states. These include T and B lymphocytes of the adaptive immune system and neutrophils and monocytes of the innate immune system. Leukocytes do not enter the brain in significant numbers in non-disease conditions. Consequently, we investigate molecular and cellular interactions between the periphery and the brain taking place at the blood-brain interfaces. We are particularly focused on the meninges, where leukocytes normally reside sequestered in the subarachnoid spaces. Cells in this compartment can release bioactive molecules that circulate throughout the brain in the cerebrospinal fluid to potentially influence brain activity. We track leukocytes in the meninges using 1) whole-mount meningeal preparations for histochemical determination of cellular identity and 2) flow cytometry for molecular analysis of cell types and activation states. In addition, cells recovered from the meninges and brain by cell sorting were applied to microarray chips and single-cell RNA-Seq platforms to interrogate gene expression profiles. Flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry of leukocytes indicated that CSD elevates neutrophil numbers in meninges and brain. Single-cell RNA-Seq analysis showed unique gene ontology classifications for each cell type from control and stressed meninges.We found that CSD increased splenic B cell activation and secretion of the immunoregulatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10. Meningeal B cells were prevalent in homeostasis but substantially decreased during CSD, whereas activated monocytes increased.  Single-cell RNA sequencing of meningeal B cells demonstrated the induction of innate immune transcriptional programmes following stress, including genes encoding antimicrobial peptides that are known to alter myeloid cell activation. CD19 knockout mice with reduced B cells showed baseline meningeal myeloid cell activation and decreased exploratory behaviour. Together, these data suggest that B cells may influence behavior by regulating meningeal myeloid cell activation.Similar studies are directed at lymphopenic Rag2 knockout mice that received adoptive transfer of lymphocytes programmed in vitro towards Th0, Th1, Th2, or Th17 T helper cell phenotypes. We previously showed in this adoptive transfer paradigm that lymphocytes transferred from stressed mice conferred antidepressant-like effects on the Rag2 knockout host mice, and current studies with lymphocyte subsets are aimed at disclosing the mechanism for this effect. Such studies may lead to insights into new targets for therapeutic interventions in psychiatric disorders.","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

It would be helpful to know how normal perceptions arise to design strategies for ameliorating these negative feelings. To address this class of problems, we are studying how information about visual stimuli is coded and utilized. The fundamental elements for information processing in the brain, the neurons, process and carry information by working with a series of impulses, where different numbers of pulses represent different messages. No one neuron carries much information so the information represented in the messages of different neurons must be integrated to give rise to mental events such as sensation, memory, and coordinated movements. To understand how these higher functions arise, for example, visual perception, it is important to identify the aspects of neuronal responses that carry information important for stimulus coding, and how that information is used for stimulus identification and recognition in cognitive processes. This requires learning what codes are used by individual neurons, how the information they represent is processed and transformed, and how the information is integrated across populations of connected neurons. Therefore, we combine studies of single neurons, multiple neurons and behavior, to learn how higher functions such as visual perception and memory arise.","Visual perceptual categorization is a process whereby objects are assigned to groups based on similarity of visual features. This process requires both visual perception and visual memory. Two brain areas in the primate temporal lobe, areas TE and rhinal cortex are candidate regions for the neural substrates serving visual categorization. Area TE is considered to be the final stage of pure visual perception and object recognition. Rhinal cortex, the next stage of visual processing, is important as a node for visual memory. Whether or not rhinal cortex plays a role in visual perception is heavily debated. A previous selective lesion study from our lab showed that bilateral rhinal cortex lesions did not impair visual categorization, whereas bilateral TE removals mildly impaired visual categorization. Now we have investigated the role of TE and rhinal cortex in visual categorization further by making selective removals of each area and then testing the monkeys under conditions of increased task difficulty. We presume the monkeys need to accumulate perceptual evidence to respond correctly. To vary task difficulty, we manipulated the presentation duration of visual stimuli. Monkeys were trained to indicate whether a cue image, morphed between dogs and cats at 11 different levels of mixing, was more dog-like or cat-like. The cue image durations could be 25, 50, 100, 250 or 500ms, selected randomly trial-by-trial. Compared to unoperated controls, monkeys with bilateral TE lesions showed impaired categorization performance at all stimulus durations, but information processing time was not significantly different across the control and TE. Bilateral rhinal cortex lesions did not impair monkeys' categorization performance, but the information processing time was longer. That is, the monkeys with the rhinal cortex removals  were slower to respond. For all groups, processing time increased with longer cue image durations and with increasing ambiguity of morph level. We also adopted a failure rate analysis to study the decision-making process. The results suggest that it takes more time for monkeys to make decisions after rhinal cortex lesions than it does for unoperated controls. TE removals did not affect the decision times. Overall, our results support the idea that TE might play a more perceptual role and rhinal cortex might play a more cognitive role in categorization-based decision making. One possibility is that rhinal cortex facilitates perceptual evidence accumulation via memory-guided attention.The classic hierarchical structure of visual processing (V1 -> V2 -> V4 -> TEO -> TE) posits that visual information reaches TE via TEO. A previous behavioral study from our lab suggests that visual categorization is performed by areas TEO and TE in parallel. These findings challenge the classic strictly sequential hierarchical structure of the ventral visual stream. Previous anatomical studies show that a direct projection from V4 to TE exists, independent of the V4-TEO-TE pathway. But it is unknown whether V4 neurons provide bifurcating afferent projections terminating in TEO and TE. In the present study, we injected nonreplicating viruses that are transported retrogradely from axon terminals throughout the neuron. We injected viruses expressing a colored fluorescent reporter into area TEO and a reporter with another color into TE. From these viral injections we can judge 1) the relative strengths of V4 projections to TEO and TE, 2) the general distribution of TEO-projecting and TE-projecting neurons in V4, and 3) the presence or absence of V4 neurons with bifurcated projections to both TEO and TE. To inject virus across TEO and TE, we used custom multichannel microinjector arrays. The high density of fluorescently labeled neurons in the targeted areas TEO and TE show that the viral delivery method worked well. We found populations of TEO-projecting neurons and TE-projecting neurons in V4, V4t and V4v, with intermixing of colored neurons in V4. In V4v, as has been seen in earlier studies. TEO-projecting neurons are in the more medial aspect, and TE-projecting neurons are in the more lateral aspect. In addition, there is a population of single neurons that project to both TEO and TE in V4, V4t and V4v as shown by co-localization of the two colors. Thus, in addition to the considerable projection from area V4 directly to area TE, a significant proportion of the information that reaches TE arises from this population that projects to both areas.","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

In particular, we aim to understand how behaviorally relevant visual information is processed in the brain and how distracting information is effectively filtered out. To do so, we employ various experimental approaches in behaving subjects, including brain imaging in humans and monkeys as well as single-unit recordings in monkeys. The behavioral paradigms we develop in normal, healthy individuals are applied to human populations with attentional impairments, such as children suffering from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a neurobehavioral disorder characterized by pervasive inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity that often results in substantial functional impairment, both in and outside of the classroom. Prevalence estimates of ADHD in school-aged children are close to 10%, with more than half of those diagnosed reported to be taking medication for the disorder. Hence, a thorough understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying attention would have important public health implications. This work was conducted under protocol 10-M-0047 (NCT01087281) and 93-M-0170 (NCT00001360).","A typical scene contains many different objects that compete for neural representation due to the limited processing capacity of the visual system. At the neural level, competition among multiple objects is evidenced by the mutual suppression of their visually evoked responses. The competition among multiple objects can be biased by both bottom-up sensory-driven mechanisms (exogenous attention), such as stimulus salience, and top-down, goal-directed influences, such as selective, endogenous attention. Although the competition among multiple objects for representation is ultimately resolved within visual cortex, the source of top-down biasing signals likely derives from a distributed network of areas in frontal and parietal cortex. During the past year, we completed two studies and made progress on two others.In the first completed study (Yue et al., 2020), we investigated cortical areas involved in the processing of the curvature of objects. We found a network of curvature preferring cortical patchessome of which overlapped with typical face-selective areas. We also found that curvilinear features of visual stimuli are associated with topographic maps in visual cortex. Our results support the hypothesis that curvilinearity preference interacts with topographic biases as primary features underlying the organization of temporal cortex in the adult human brain.In the second completed study (Yetter et al., 2021), we investigated the extent to which the ability to discriminate animate and inanimate objects is facilitated by image-based features that distinguish the two object categories. In a behavioral study in monkeys, we showed that macaques can classify novel images into animate and inanimate categories with high accuracy after nominal training. Next, we used synthetic images that distorted the global shape of the images while maintaining their intermediate features. We showed that the monkeys could classify these images above chance based on the amount of curvilinear information in the image, i.e., images with more curvature were classified as animate and images with more rectilinear features as inanimate. Our results demonstrate that macaques can use an intermediate image feature such as curvilinearity, to facilitate their categorization based on animacy.In an ongoing study, we explored how humans attend to and extract information from others actions. Using behavioral experiments and extensive analysis of videos of human grasping actions, we showed that humans are able to predict the target of a grasp when viewing hand movement. Participants made systematic errors in their judgments. In addition, when asked to judge the similarity of grasp movements, their judgments systematically deviated from objective grasp movements. These results suggest that the understanding of others grasp movements relies on mechanisms (and possibly neural underpinnings) that are distinct from those used for performing grasp movements. The analysis for this study is ongoing.We also made progress on an experiment to investigate the processing of visual objects for grasp. To judge the similarity between objects, we attend to a collection of features (geometric, semantic, etc.). When making an action to grasp an object, we also attend to a subset of geometric features. It is not clear if the same mechanisms that underlie general object knowledge also support processing object shapes for grasp. We recorded grasp movements towards 58 3D-printed objects. We used these movements to extract features relevant for grasp. In a separate experiment, we asked other participants to judge the similarity between these objects and then used these data to extract features relevant for general object similarity ratings. Surprisingly, the features relevant for grasp were largely distinct from those used for general similarity judgments, suggesting that the mechanisms for extracting these features may diverge in the brain. These experimental measures are now being used in an fMRI study to identify visual brain regions that process object features for grasp. We designed a setup to allow participants to view and grasp 3D-printed objects inside an MRI scanner. Using this setup and correlating the behavioral measures with the fMRI responses to the objects, we will explore the role of occipitotemporal and parietal cortices in processing the shape of objects to plan a grasping movement.","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

We develop pharmacological reagents to inhibit or stimulate those components. These are deployed both to learn basic principles governing peptide and biogenic amine neurotransmission, and for potential translation to human diseases involving dysregulation of rewarding, aversive, and stressful responding. The pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) through its PAC1 receptor and dopamine (DA) through its D1 receptor elevate post-synaptic cyclic AMP (through Gs) after secretion from pre-synaptic neurons. We have previously identified in cell culture the parcellation of cAMP signaling through these receptors based on independent activation of one of three cAMP sensor/effectors, protein kinase A (PKA), Epac, or NCS-Rapgef2. NCS-Rapgef2 is the main focus of the laboratory. The lab has discovered, over the past eight years, that this protein is the major signaling protein linking cAMP elevation to activation of the mitogen activated protein kinase ERK in neurons and endocrine cells. ERK activation has been shown to be an obligate signaling molecule mediating neuronal plasticity occurring in dopaminoceptive neurons of the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens) leading to drug seeking behavior after chronic psychomotor stimulant imbibition. It is also required for mediating maladaptation to stress anchored in neuronal circuits of the extended amygdala. ERK is further implicated in associative learning mechanisms reflected in and required for neuronal plasticity within the trisynaptic pathway of the hippocampus. It is therefore the long-term goal of the Section on Molecular Neuroscience to understand the molecular details of the cAMP->NCS-Rapgef2->ERK pathway and its involvement in synaptic and cellular plasticity that makes possible behavioral responses to rewarding, aversive and stressful experience in these three areas of the mammalian brain.","The eleven publications from the SMN in the past calendar year comprise seven primary reports arising from data obtained in the laboratory, and four reviews or book chapters summarizing recent progress in the neuropeptide field.

Most of our work involves two Gs-coupled receptors, DRD1 (for dopamine) and PAC1 (for PACAP) that signal mainly through elevation of cyclic AMP. We are building a new view of cyclic AMP signaling in which cyclic AMP activates immediate early genes for neuronal plasticity encoding experience by two separate pathways, one dedicated to fos activation and acting through the threonine-serine protein kinase A, and one dedicated to activation of the immediate early gene Egr1/Zif268 via the MAP kinase ERK, and acting through the guanine nucleotide exchanger NCS-RapGEF2.

This forebrain neural system receives inputs from all cortical areas and processes that input through the striatum. The striatum's output pathways provide feedback, through the thalamus, to cortical areas involved in the selection and control of behavior. Our work uses neuroanatomical methods to study the connectional organization of the basal ganglia to study the regulation of gene expression responsible for neuronal plasticity within the striatum. Work in our laboratory established that D1 and D2 dopamine receptor subtypes are segregated in the ""direct"" and ""indirect"" striatal output neurons, which is the basis of how dopamine maintains the balanced function of striatal output pathways (Gerfen et al., 1990). Neuromodulators such as dopamine act to alter the long-term response of neurons to synaptic input, such as the glutamatergic excitatory input from the cortex. Such neuroplasticity is mediated by the activation of neurotransmitter receptor-mediated activation of protein kinase signal transduction pathways. This results in the activation of transcription factors and induction of specific genes that are responsible for altering synaptic responses. We demonstrated that in the striatum, the ""direct"" and ""indirect"" striatal projection neurons support distinct forms of neuronal plasticity that affect responses to cortical input, through the differential activation of distinct protein kinase signaling pathways. Dopamine maintains these different forms of response. Dysfunction of the striatum following dopamine lesions in animal models of Parkinson's disease, appears to be due to a particularly aberrant form of neuronal plasticity. The aberrant form is due to a switch in the regulation of a particular protein kinase signal transduction pathway. The purpose of these studies is to better establish how disorders of the basal ganglia, such as Parkinson's disease, result in clinical movement disorders, and whether the basal ganglia might also be involved in such mental disorders, such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, or in the abuse of psychoactive drugs.A major limitation of our research and others' research to relate neuroanatomical circuits to both typical and atypical behavior is the complex functional organization of brain circuits. While neuroanatomical studies in our laboratory have unraveled much of the underlying organization of the basal ganglia, research approaches to study the function of these circuits in animal models have been difficult. One promising approach has been the development of genetically engineered transgenic mouse lines in which the enzyme Cre-recombinase is expressed in specific neuron types, neural circuits or brain regions. Combining such expression with floxed constructs enables the ability to experimentally manipulate very specific components of neuroanatomical circuits. These mice are being developed and characterized to provide powerful new research tools to the neuroscience research community. Our contribution to this effort is to characterize the specific pattern of expression of Cre-recombinase as part of the NINDS/NIMH funded GENSAT project.","Advances in molecular genetic techniques are revealing new details of the neuroanatomical organization of brain circuitry and the functional role of these circuits in behavior. Engineered viral vector constructs have been developed to label axonal projections of targeted neurons with unprecedented clarity, while others allow for retrograde trans-synaptic labeling of neurons providing inputs or anterograde trans-synaptic labeling of post-synaptic targets of axonal projections. These approaches provide new insights into the functional organization of neural circuits. For example, optogenetic studies have demonstrated the ability to functionally manipulate specific neural pathways to determine their role in behaviors including fear memory, anxiety, feeding, and movement. The analytic potential of these approaches is enhanced by the ability to target specific neuron populations, which are defined components of neural circuits. In recent years as part of the GENSAT project we characterized BAC-Cre driver lines that allow for targeting components of the neural circuits of the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia (Gerfen et al., 2013). These BAC-Cre lines are widely used in research laboratories around the world, being used in over 300 publications per year in studies to determine the function of specific neuronal brain circuits.Our work focuses on the organization of neural circuits responsible for integrating different modes of sensory and experiential information that is utilized in the planning and execution of behavior. To do this we use viral vectors that label the axons of specific cortical neuron subtypes in GENSAT BAC-Cre mouse lines. To analyze these complex patterns of connectivity we developed an efficient process for reconstructing the images through the whole mouse brain using the NIH ImageJ program (Paletzki and Gerfen, 2015). These fully reconstructed whole mouse brain image sets displaying the axonal projections of specific neuron subtypes in multiple cortical areas are registered to a common mouse brain atlas. The ability to register patterns of axonal projections obtained from many brains provides the ability to analyze the complex organization of the neural circuits integrating information between functional cortical areas and how it is transmitted to subcortical circuits responsible for behavior (Eastwood et al., 2019).  We are currently working with Ted Usdin (NIMH) to use techniques to clear whole mouse brains combined with light-sheet microscopy to image and analyze neural circuits.In the past year we collaborated with investigators in NIMH, NIAAA, and NEI, at Duke University, Northwestern University, Columbia University, Baylor College of Medicine, the Max Planck Institute for Neuroscience, University of California San Francisco, Howard Hughes Medical Institute Janelia Farms Research, and the University of Pittsburgh.  Our contribution to these studies was to provide neuroanatomical expertise in imaging and analyzing neural circuits to determine the relationship between the organization of information transfer between sensory, motor and association cortical areas and the planning and initiation of movements. During this year neuroanatomical techniques were developed to analyze the functional organization of the relationship between the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia and subcortical circuits including the amygdala, thalamus and midbrain.Soohyun Lee's lab in NIMH is working out the fine details of how local circuits of GABAergic cortical neurons affect the activity of pyramidal neurons in the barrel field of the cerebral cortex.  Their study demonstrates that long range inputs from different cortical and subcortical areas differentially and selectively synapse on distinct subtypes of somatostatin, parvalbuminin and VIP interneurons (Naskar et al., 2021).  These findings were obtained using techniques we developed to analyze whole brain mapping of neuroanatomical circuits.  Work in Savio Chan's lab demonstrated direct inputs from the cerebral cortex to the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe) using data generated in our laboratory using whole brain mapping of projections from a subtype of layer 5 neuron, pyramidal tract neurons (Abecassis et al., 2019).  Work with Rui Costa's lab involved studies of a circuit including projections from the basolateral amygdala to the central nucleus, a variant of the cortico-striatal pathway (Botta et al., 2020).  This circuit was demonstrated to mediate experience-dependent momentary arrests during exploration. In a continuing collaboration with the Krauzlis lab in NEI, the role of the basal ganglia in perceptual decision-making as distinguished from action selection, with which it is more typically associated, was studied. In a prior study, using a visual orientation-change detection task it was demonstrated that manipulation of striatal output pathways increased the response to the sensory stimulus and not due to a general increase in response initiation (Wang et al., 2018).   Further evidence of a role in this function is provided by the demonstration that an output target of basal ganglia, the superior colliculus is causally involved in perceptual decision making (Wang et al., 2020).   Separate collabortions with Nuo LI (Baylor College of Medicine) and Hidehiko Inagaki (Max Planck Institute) are studying specific neuroanatomical circuits connecting premotor cortical areas, the striatum and basal ganglia output circuits connecting the thalamus, superior colliculus and midbrain motor area involved in sensory triggers, preparatory activity, action and perceptual selection preceding movement initiation.  In addition to specific connections between neuron subtypes within and between different brain areas mechanisms involved in neuronal responses to synaptic input is critical to understanding how brain circuits are involved in behavior.  A longstanding interest in our lab has been to understand the effects of dopamine and acetylcholine on different subtypes of neurons in the striatum.   Dopamine has opponent affects on the two main pathways of the basal ganglia due to the segregation of the D1 and D2 receptors respectively to the direct and indirect pathway striatal neurons (Gerfen et al., 1990).  The D1 receptor couples through the Gs (stimulatory) protein to engage signaling pathways that effect direct pathway neuron functions.  Prior work from our lab demonstrated differences between the D1r-direct pathway neurons in the dorsal and ventral striatum in the coupling through the D1r to downstream signaling systems involving activation of the kinase ERK1/2 (Gerfen et al., 2002,  2008). Differences were most apparent in animal models of Parkinsons Disease and in response to psychostimulants such as cocaine.  Recent work in the Eiden lab has made significant advances in understanding these differences.  Prior work had identified a novel protein, NCS-Rapgef2, as critical to coupling D1r to activation of ERK1/2 (Emery et al., 2012).   In a study of cocaines behavioral effects, a new model of ERK activation in D1-dopaminoceptive neurons was proposed.  Signaling through the D1r in striatal neurons had been thought to mediated exclusively through PKA coupled to cAMP.  However, our findings demonstrated that cAMP coupling to RapGef2 to activate ERK is independent of PKA.  This suggests that D1r signaling pathways coupling to PKA and ERK occur through distinct parallel pathways that are differentially regulated to effect changes in gene regulation responsible for long term plasticity affecting behavior.   Nicole Calakos at Duke University developed a technique to visualize neuron activity related to the integrated stress response (ISR). Using this approach we found that dopamine signaling in striatal cholinergic neurons engages the ISR during skill learning (Helseth et al., 2021)","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

We expect that our findings will provide novel insights into the actions of vasopressin (Avp) and oxytocin (Oxt) in rodent brain and suggest potential avenues to explore in humans. The role of Oxt in social recognition and affiliation in voles and mice has led to the speculation that a disturbance within the Oxt system may be involved in autism and other social disorders. We have shown that the Avpr1b is expressed almost entirely within the CA2 region of the hippocampus and is especially important for aggression. We are using regular and conditional knockouts of the Avpr1b and Oxtr to examine the development of behaviors with an unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution. We are using various viral delivery systems to express proteins in specific regions of the brain to understand what the roles of these receptors are in particular locations. We recently showed that stimulation of the vasopressinergic pathway to the CA2 area greatly enhances social memory. We are continuing to use optogenetics and electrophysiology to further explore their roles in learning and memory in the hippocampus. We believe that behavioral studies using our knockouts will provide insights fundamental to understanding certain mental illnesses.

Depression risk increases during the perimenopause, and depression is cited as a primary reason for resuming menopausal hormone therapy (HT). Community-based epidemiologic studies demonstrate that most women experience no significant symptoms of depression during the menopause transition. Importantly, these studies also document a 1.5 to 3-fold increased risk of first onset and recurrent depressions in perimenopausal women compared with premenopausal women (and in some studies, those who are several years postmenopause). These latter findings suggest that hormonal events accompanying this stage of life might underlie the affective dysregulation that occurs in some women. However, few studies have been able to examine whether the pattern of reproductive aging differs between women at risk for perimenopausal depression compared to those who remain euthymic across the transition.  The development of depression at midlife is important for several reasons. First, in addition to the well-documented morbidity related to an episode of depression, depression (even subsyndromal depression) conveys an increased risk for all-cause mortality in women at midlife as well as the risk for several specific medical illnesses relevant to women at midlife including osteoporosis, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease. Indeed, evidence suggests that the presence of even subsyndromal depression in a menopausal woman can increase cardiovascular mortality by up to 50 percent relative to non-depressed postmenopausal women. Second, during the past decade there has been an increase in the suicide rate at midlife in women suggesting depression at this time frequently goes unrecognized or is considered a normal accompaniment of the menopause transition. Finally, the identification of novel therapeutic interventions in these conditions will narrow existing treatment gaps for the many women who experience these conditions. Thus, our studies provide an unparalleled opportunity to uncover the biological and environmental underpinnings of susceptibility to affective dysregulation. The specific goals and objectives for this project are as follows: 1) Define the role of estradiol withdrawal in the precipitation of depression during the perimenopause. 2) Identify the predictors of the risk for the development of depression in the context of ovarian aging. 3) Determine the mood and behavioral effects of selective estrogen receptor beta modulators in perimenopause-related depression. 4) Characterize the clinical characteristics, antecedents to and accompaniments  of disturbances in mood and behavior occurring in the context of the perimenopause.The long-range goals are to identify the mechanisms underlying the effects of ovarian  steroids on affective state regulation in women and the accompaniments (e.g., negative life events, vasomotor symptoms, neuroendocrine changes, HPA axis dysregulation, early life trauma) of depression during the perimenopause.","This report includes work arising from the following clinical protocols: NCT00030147, NCT00060736, NCT00001231, NCT03689543 and NCT00001322. Our cross-sectional findings to date show that perimenopause-related depression (PMD) is accompanied by a decreased QOL, decreased social adjustment, increased negative life events and impaired role functioning compared to matched asymptomatic perimenopausal women, but similar to depression occurring at other stages in a womans life. Additionally, depressive episodes during the perimenopause cluster during the late menopause transition, where there are usually the largest declines in estradiol secretion. This observation suggests that a subset of women could have a genetically predisposed sensitivity to rapidly declining estradiol. Moreover, hormone therapy (HT) can alleviate or prevent depression in perimenopausal women, whereas women who stop HT often have a reoccurrence of depressive symptoms. Intriguingly, ovarian steroid levels (including estradiol) are normal in PMD compared to reproductively matched women without PMD; thus, women with PMD are not simply more estrogen deficient. In a placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical study, we previously demonstrated that asymptomatic postmenopausal women with past PMD who were crossed over from estradiol-treatment to placebo experienced a significant recurrence of depressive symptoms, whereas women who had never experienced depression during perimenopause or who continued receiving estradiol-treatment had no change in symptoms. These findings suggest that women who experience PMD have a differential affective response to otherwise identical changes in estradiol specifically, and independently, of other events accompanying the menopause transition. As steroid hormones such as estradiol traditionally act at the cellular level to alter gene transcription and neural signaling, we hypothesized that we could observe differences in cellular response, both innately (i.e., in the absence of ovarian steroids) and during estradiol-withdrawal, in PMD.The therapeutic benefits of estradiol and symptom-provoking effects of estradiol-withdrawal suggest that a greater sensitivity to changes in estradiol at the cellular level contribute to PMD. We developed an in vitro model of PMD with lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from participants of a prior estradiol-withdrawal clinical study. LCLs from women with past PMD or control women were cultured in three experimental conditions: at vehicle baseline, during estradiol treatment, and following estradiol-withdrawal. Whole transcriptome analysis revealed significant differences in transcript expression in PMD in all experimental conditions, and significant overlap in genes which were changed in PMD regardless of experimental condition. Of these, CXCL10, previously linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, was upregulated in women with PMD, but most robustly after estradiol-withdrawal. A second gene, CYP7B1, an enzyme intrinsic to DHEA metabolism, was upregulated in PMD across all three experimental conditions. These differences in CYP7B1/CXCL10 expression provide evidence that both intrinsic cellular differences (hormone state-independent) as well as differential sensitivity to estradiol-withdrawal (hormone state-dependent) could contribute to the onset and/or sequella of the estradiol-withdrawal-related affective state in PMD. These transcripts were further validated via qRT-PCR. Gene networks dysregulated in PMD included inflammatory response, early/late estradiol response, and cholesterol homeostasis. Our results provide evidence that differential behavioral responsivity to estradiol-withdrawal in PMD reflects intrinsic differences in cellular gene expression. Genes such as CXCL10, CYP7B1, and corresponding proinflammatory and steroid biosynthetic gene networks, may represent biomarkers and molecular targets for intervention in PMD. Finally, this in vitro model allows for future investigations into the mechanisms of genes and gene networks involved in the vulnerability to, and consequences of, PMD.Our initial evidence that estradiol therapy is an effective treatment for PMD was recently confirmed. Indeed, our recent findings replicate the results of three randomized, placebo-controlled trials, employing similar diagnostic criteria for PMD, documenting the beneficial effects of TE in this condition. Although all three trials were limited by relatively small samples, the combined sample size of over 170 women with well-characterized PMD strongly supports the efficacy of TE in this condition. Nonetheless, concerns about the long-term safety of any formulation of estrogen therapy remain even for TE, which is suggested to have lower safety risks especially in younger perimenopausal women. Given our prior demonstration that estradiol withdrawal precipitates depressive symptoms in women with past PMD  (behavioral changes not observed in controls undergoing the same hormone manipulation), we now are employing this study design to examine the ability of a selective estrogen receptor beta agonist (LY300507) to prevent estradiol withdrawal-induced depressive symptoms in women with past PMD. The role of estrogen receptor beta is suggested to be more involved in brain and behavior that estrogen receptor alpha and to have a lower impact on tissue growth and metabolism within the body. Thus, it would be predicted that if this estrogen receptor beta agonist prevents estradiol withdrawal-induced depressive symptoms in women with past PMD that this compound could have antidepressant efficacy in women with current PMD.  Finally, it remains unclear whether the clinical characteristics we identified in our cross-sectional studies reflect pre-existing risk factors for PMD or the negative impact of a current depression. To clarify the relative relationship of these potential accompaniments of (or antecedents to) PMD we have completed  a high-density, prospective, longitudinal study of healthy asymptomatic women who were followed during and after their transition through the menopause with diagnostic interviews, symptom ratings (daily, weekly and at semi-annual clinic visits) and blood measures. Eighty-eight asymptomatic, premenopausal women, ages 41-55 years, were monitored longitudinally for an average of 5.2 years (range of 1  12 years) until at least 6-12 months after their last menstrual period (LMP). Our preliminary results confirm the clustering of depressive episodes in proximity to the LMP. We prospectively identified twenty-nine episodes of major or minor (subsyndromal) depression that occurred in twenty-two women; twenty-one of these episodes occurred within the 24 months surrounding the LMP. The clustering of depressions during the late menopause transition (STRAW stage -1 to +1a) is convergent with our clinic-based cross-sectional studies. We have not received the final results of the blood hormone measures. We plan to employ a logistic regression model to examine serial plasma samples in women who do and do not develop PMD during the menopausal transition to characterize and compare the kinetics (e.g., mean levels, variability, peak levels, percent change relative to mean level of estradiol secretion) prior to the LMP. Additionally, we will employ this longitudinal sample to evaluate several potential markers in blood of PMD including several measures identified in our functional genomics studies. Ultimately, we will evaluate how multiple risk factors including estradiol variability, adrenal androgen levels, past psychiatric history, sleep disturbance, reports of hot flushes, negative life events and marital satisfaction load on the development of PMD.",There were no publications during this reporting period,"[('Karen F Berman, MD Section on Integrative Neuroimaging', 'Section on Integrative Neuroimaging')]",,

The goal of our research is to elucidate the neural circuits that underpin these abilities in the human brain. Specifically, we seek to identify the neural structures that allow us to quickly and efficiently distinguish self and other animate entities from inanimate objects, and that support our ability to understand complex social interactions. Because these abilities are wholly dependent on prior knowledge (memory), we also seek to identify the neural structures associated with the acquisition, storage, and retrieval processes associated with different types of memory. To accomplish these goals we use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) to measure changes in neural activity as participants perform different types of tasks. We also use these brain imaging modalities to record spontaneous neural activity to evaluate the brain's intrinsic neurocircuitry. This work was conducted under protocol NCT00001360.","During this past year we have concentrated our efforts on addressing outstanding issues concerning the three major divisions of memory: semantic or conceptual memory composed of our knowledge about things and ideas, explicit or autobiographical memory composed of recollections of our life events, and priming, a form of implicit memory that underlies our ability to recognize objects fast and efficiently. One of the most prominent models of the functional neuroanatomy of semantic memory posits that the more anterior region of the temporal lobes functions as a domain-general convergence zone, or hub, for all semantic information. This view is at odds with evidence from our lab and others that indicate that the anterior temporal lobe (commonly referred to as the ATL) comprises multiple anatomic and functional subdivisions. There have been two major obstacles to using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify the precise functional organization of the ATL: the difficult choice of stimuli and tasks to activate, and dissociate, specific regions within the ATL, and poor signal quality because of magnetic field distortions in this region of the brain. To circumvent these difficulties, we developed a data-driven parcellation routine and an imaging sequence optimized to enhance signal in the ATL. Our analysis revealed that the ATL is composed of at least 34 distinct functional regions. In addition, the region most often claimed as the location of the semantic hub was found to be part of a domain-specific network associated with face and social processing, rather than a domain-general semantic hub. These findings offer a fine-grained functional map of the ATL and offer an initial step toward using more precise language to describe the locations of functional responses in this heterogeneous region of human cortex (Persichetti et al., Journal of Neuroscience, 2021).Several of our other studies of semantic memory have focused on the relationship between the neural systems for representing higher-order conceptual information and lower-level sensory information. We recently established, using high field (7-tesla), high-resolution fMRI, that taste information (sweet, salty, and sour tastes) is represented in gustatory cortex by a population code, rather than by a taste-specific spatial map (Avery et al., Journal of Neuroscience, 2020). Building on this finding we asked whether this brain region also contained a population code for representing the inferred tastes associated with different types of foods. Specifically, we asked whether simply viewing pictures of foods defined primarily by their dominant taste (e.g., pictures of candy, pretzels, lemons) would activate the same region of gustatory cortex active when experiencing these tastes, and whether these inferred tastes were represented by a population code rather than by a spatial map. Again, using ultra-high resolution fMRI at high magnetic field strength, we found that this was indeed the case. Viewing food pictures triggered the automatic retrieval of specific taste quality information associated with the depicted foods and that this information was represented by a population code (Avery et al., Proceedings of the National Academy, 2021). These results also showed how higher-order inferences derived from stimuli in one modality (i.e., vision) can be represented in a region of the brain typically thought to represent only low-level information about a different modality (i.e., taste).We are also interested in how memory for our life events and occurrences (autobiographical memory) are represented in the brain. For several decades, the role played during autobiographical retrieval by the hippocampus  one of the central brain regions in memory functioning  has been hotly debated. One model (The Standard Consolidation Model) asserts that via a time-dependent process of cortical consolidation, the hippocampus is no longer required for successful retrieval of remote events (e.g., during childhood). In contrast, others have argued that the critical determinate of hippocampal involvement is not how long ago the event occurred, but the precision and detail of the memory. In this view, the hippocampus is always required for vividly recalling memories (The Multiple Trace hypothesis). Although the models make clear predictions, distinguishing between them has been complicated by the tendency for memories to become more schematic and less detailed over time, such that age and vividness are confounded.   The debate for and against temporally graded activity in the hippocampus rest largely on the subjective phenomenology of retrieved memories. In this regard, fMRI studies of autobiographical memory have suffered in particular because of their reliance upon covert, or silent, recall because of concerns about in-scanner head motion. We overcame this problem by capitalizing on recent advances in fMRI acquisition and analysis that allowed our participants to overtly recall their recent and remote memories during scanning. In accordance with the predictions of the Standard Consolidation Model, we found that the hippocampus became less and less active the more remote the retrieved memory, with no hippocampal activity detected for memories recalled from the most distant past. Moreover, by careful analysis of the actual verbal memory reports generated by our participants we were able to show that this result was not due to the amount or quality of the details recalled (Gilmore et al., Proceedings of the National Academy, 2021). The same verbal reports provided a means of examining how autobiographical memories are retrieved in real-time, as changes in neural activity could be correlated with changes in content as it was being described. The results indicated rich, complex retrieval dynamics, whereby domain-specific cortices are transiently reactivated to support moment-to-moment re-experiencing of an event (Gilmore et al., Journal of Neuroscience, 2021).Finally, our studies of implicit memory have focused on the behavioral and neural underpinnings of a powerful form of learning known as priming.  It has longed been recognized that our ability to identify a stimulus improves with repetition (repetition priming), whereas neural activity decreases (repetition suppression). Multiple models have been proposed to explain this unexpected brain-behavior relationship (i.e., improved performance coupled with decreased brain activity). Some prominent models predict that this phenomenon is underpinned by changes in neural connectivity between specific brain regions (Synchrony and Predictive Coding models), others predict changes in the latency of neural responses (Facilitation model), and others in a change in the relative similarity of neural representations (Sharpening model). In a recent study we tested these predictions with fMRI while participants named repeated and non-repeated objects. While we found partial support for predictions of the Facilitation and Sharpening models, the data were most consistent with the Synchrony model, with increased coupling between specific regions of the brain for repeated objects that correlated with the magnitude of the behavioral facilitation associated with object repetition (priming) (Gotts et al., Communications Biology, 2021). Surprisingly, increased regional coupling and the neural phenomenon of repetition suppression varied independently, a finding we will pursue in future studies.","Ordered by reference within the summary, then by publication type and author name.

Motivation is directly related to the subjective value of reward, and is moderated, or even completely dissipated, if the perceived effort or discomfort seems too great. The normal balance between reward and work is disturbed in many psychiatric disorders, such as depression where feelings of hopelessness make rewards seem not worth pursuing and the work to obtain them too burdensome, or drug abuse where the drug of abuse is so valuable it will be sought even at great danger or cost, both personal and social. We are studying how the value of behavior is modified by the balance between reward value and burden to obtain reward in monkeys. The monkeys naturally vary their performance while we manipulate the reward size and the amount of work needed to obtain reward. We carry out theoretical studies trying to describe the exact balance among these factors, behavioral studies with both normal monkeys and monkeys with selective ablations, single neuron recordings to learn what signals related to these factors are present in different brain regions of the reward system, and genetically-based receptor manipulations to determine what the underlying molecular mechanisms for this behavior are.","Primates, including old-world monkeys, learn stimulus-reward associations seemingly without effort. We previously showed that rhinal cortex has a causal role in associating value with visual stimuli, with monkeys without a rhinal cortex being less sensitive to previously learned stimulus-reward associations and learning new associations between visual cues and reward schedule states slowly, if at all. Rostromedial caudate (rmCD) also plays a causal role in stimulus-reward associations. When rmCD is inactivated chemogenetically, monkeys show a deficit in evaluating the size of the upcoming reward signaled by visual cues. There is a known connection between deep layers of the rhinal cortex projecting to rmCD. Here, we interrupted this connection by combining a unilateral rhinal cortex lesion with contralateral expression of an hM4Di DREADD via a retrograde lentivirus (FugE) injected into rmCD. The monkey was trained to perform a task with four visual cues, which signaled the upcoming reward of one, two, four or eight drops of water, respectively. A new set of cues was used each day. Without chemogenetic inactivation, the monkey learned quickly to accept only the two larger sizes of reward and refuse the smaller rewards. When all neurons projecting to rmCD were silenced by systemically injected DCZ, the monkey needed significantly more trials to learn the stimulus-reward mapping. The monkeys decision time also increased. To manipulate projection neurons from rhinal cortex to rmCD selectively, on some days, microinjections (3ul x 4 sites, 100nM) of DCZ were made into perirhinal cortex. The microinjections led to a small but significant deficit in the stimulus-reward mapping. Thus, our results show that projection neurons from rhinal cortex to rmCD are causally involved in the learning of visual stimulus-reward associations.  The orbital frontal cortex (OFC) and rostromedial caudate (rmCD) are brain regions considered important for reward value processing and decision-making. The OFC is thought to be involved mainly in reward value assessment, whereas the rmCD is thought to play a role in reward expectation and action selection. To identify neurons that project from other areas to both of these regions, we injected retrograde viruses expressing red or green fluorescent reporters into the OFC and rmCD, respectively. After injection of the viral vectors, histological analysis showed a population of neurons in many regions co-expressing both fluorescent reporters, indicating that these neurons co-project to the OFC and rmCD. These neurons were located within higher order visual areas (V4 and TE) but were also identified in brain areas involved with processing spatial and emotional salience, such as the amygdala, rhinal cortex, and insula. Perhaps surprisingly, in the hemisphere contralateral to the injection site, these same regions had a larger than expected percentage of co-projecting neurons, that is, neurons that expressed both the red and green reporters, relative to neurons projecting to either OFC or rmCD alone. For example, in the amygdala of the ipsilateral hemisphere, approximately 20% of the neurons projecting to OFC also projected to rmCD, but from the contralateral amygdala nearly all OFC-projecting neurons also projected to rmCD. We are further characterizing the population of co-projecting neurons, which presumably carries identical signals to two brain regions thought to underlie reward evaluation and may play a role in the normalization of sensory information. Signals for reward value are distributed widely throughout the brain and are thought to be important for evaluating sensory stimuli when faced with behavioral choices. One mechanism for normalizing the value of sensory information is divisive normalization. In the early visual system normalization of luminance is achieved through feedback inhibition of multifurcating complex cells onto simple cells. At the other end of the decision-making hierarchy, there is evidence for divisive normalization, that is, a signal to which all other signals are seen as relative rather than absolute, in human and old-world monkey choice behaviors. Here we present evidence for the existence of a widespread neuron population that could be part of a substrate for normalizing the value of sensory signals from both hemispheres by co-projecting to orbital prefrontal cortex (OFC) and the rostromedial caudate (rmCD), key structures for evaluating and updating reward signals. We identified this co-projecting neuron population in two monkeys by unilaterally injecting a retrograde lentivirus expressing a fluorescent protein with one color into OFC and a retrograde lentivirus expressing another color into rmCD. Clusters of individual neurons that expressed both colors, and thus project to both regions, were found throughout the temporal lobe and other cortical regions responsible for processing visual and emotionally relevant information, including insular cortex and the dorsomedial thalamus. The highest percentages of co-projecting neurons, relative to numbers of neurons only projecting to one of the two regions, were found in areas of the basal and medial amygdala rich in dopamine innervation, the parahippocampus (TF) and the temporal parietal occipital area (TPO). In the same regions in the contralateral hemisphere, co-projecting neurons were found in smaller numbers but with a much higher percentage of co-projecting neurons compared to populations only projecting to the OFC or rmCD individually. Any signal responsible for normalization of value-reward association would need to be collected from sensory processing regions of both hemispheres, making this neuron population a prime candidate for sending identical value information to OFC and rmCD, which could be used to feed back a signal for adjusting gains in sensory processing areas.","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

In particular, we examine pathophysiology in the frontotemporal system and in systems based on the relationship between subcortical dopamine neurons and cortical activity. This work brings together measurements of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) with 15O-water PET, neural activation with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), measurements of in vivo GABA and glutamate levels with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and comprehensive pre- and post-synaptic dopaminergic function with 18F-FDOPA, 11C-NNC112, and 18F-fallypride PET. This multifaceted approach has the potential to uncover distinctive systems-level phenotypes and mechanisms that may be helpful in the search for susceptibility genes for schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders. This work may ultimately help guide the development of desperately needed new treatments.Because the neural circuits and neurochemical indices that are tested depend upon dopamine and other neurotransmitters that can be affected by neuroleptic medications, patients are studied with these multiple imaging modalities while they are medication-free. The Clinical and Translational Neuroscience Branch inpatient unit and the drug withdrawal protocol in which many of our inpatients participate are critically important to understanding the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, particularly neurochemical features, without the confound of ongoing neuroleptic treatment. The NIMH Intramural Research Program (IRP) is one of the few clinical research facilities where work of this nature can be carried out. Similarly, this special setting allows for close integration with genetic risk discovery efforts. This work provides an active database with which to test the neurobiological implications of genetic factors identified in large consortium studies.Current work in medication-free patients with schizophrenia aims to describe dysfunction of basal as well as both reward-and executive-cognition-related neural activity via fMRI and rCBF studies in relation to clinical indices, illness risk genetics, and measures of presynaptic dopamine stores using 18F-FDOPA PET scanning. In addition, to examine the sequelae of a mechanistically different disorder of dopamine regulation, we are assembling a comparison cohort of patients with Parkinson's disease who can tolerate these same neuroimaging procedures while briefly withdrawn from their medications. We further seek to refine our understanding of cortical dopamine function in schizophrenia by incorporating into our research program the radioligands 11C-NNC112 and 18F-fallypride, which permit measurement of D1 and D2/3 receptors in the cortex, respectively. This allows us to directly test the theories that cortical dopaminergic tone plays a role in maintaining task appropriate network activity and that the ratio between D1 and D2/3 receptors influences cortical signal-to-noise ratios. These methods for testing the reciprocal subcortical-prefrontal cortex interactions that are strongly implicated in schizophrenia hold great promise for identifying the mechanisms that underlie this and other devastating neuropsychiatric illnesses.Finally, we are also taking advantage of years of work collecting clinical, cognitive, developmental, and functional data, along with genotype information, in our search for etiological and pathophysiological biomarkers that could drive  the development of more personalized and effective treatments.","The core aim of this project is to elucidate the nature, molecular foundations, underlying neurochemistry, and clinical correlates of neural systems-level dysfunction in schizophrenia. Recent efforts toward that end within the Clinical and Translational Neuroscience Branch have been manifold, including studies examining pathophysiology and phenotypic heterogeneity in our patient volunteers, collaborative stem cell studies, and studies focused on genetic and gene-by-environment interactions relevant to schizophrenia pathogenesis.Under this project, we have forwarded comprehensive, multimodal positron emission tomography- and magnetic resonance imaging-based studies of a unique and steadily growing cohort of individuals with schizophrenia who have agreed to be studied under placebo conditions (i.e., free of psychiatric medication). Though this work is necessarily challenging to conduct, we continue to make progress in data collection, which includes characterization of dopamine-dependent neurocognitive functions and brain activity, striatal presynaptic dopamine synthetic capacity, and both D1 and D2/3 dopamine receptor availability, and cognition. These studies provide the opportunity to better understand illness-related neurobiology in a clinically meaningful context, while accounting for medication effects, and to define contributors to the considerable illness heterogeneity observed in schizophrenia, which may ultimately lead to the development of precision, personalized clinical care. For instance, in multimodal, longitudinal PET studies of subcortical neurochemistry and neurophysiology in schizophrenia, we have shown that medication-related changes in both striatal basal blood flow and clinical ratings were predicted by the degree of ventral striatal presynaptic dopaminergic tone present. We have now further expanded this work to better delineate the relationships between symptom profiles and presynaptic dopaminergic tone more widely throughout the striatum in our inpatient cohorts (Eisenberg et al., 2021). These efforts pave new avenues for delineating the neurochemical mechanisms underlying heterogeneity in symptoms and in therapeutic response and form the basis of a number of studies currently underway. This body of work is informed by collaborative efforts to understand dopaminergic regulatory processes in a separate neuropsychiatric context: that of idiopathic and GBA-mutation-linked Parkinsons disease. In this vein, we have recently completed an unprecedented series of studies in which we were able to characterize years-long trajectories of striatal presynaptic dopamine synthesis capacity in GBA mutation carriers with and without Parkinsonism (Lopez et al., 2020).Recognizing both the multifaceted nature of and the interindividual variation in clinical and cognitive disruptions in schizophrenia, we have embarked on a series of experiments aimed at parsing variability in both symptoms and neuropsychological performance measurements in order to generate biologically meaningful patient subgroups that might ultimately have implications for personalized treatment in this illness. For example, in cluster analyses of clinical ratings from a large cohort of individuals with schizophrenia, we have identified three reliable clinical subgroups based on symptom profile: low-symptom, deficit, and distress groups; these groups demonstrated distinct patterns of clinical illness severity, cognitive functioning, and personality ratings, and were consistent with an independent sample of individuals with childhood-onset schizophrenia. Furthermore, in the adult sample, these subgroups were distinguished by differential frontoparietal neural recruitment during working memory performance, suggesting that clinical distinctions between these groups extend to neurobiology. Having established over many years that frontoparietal network, working memory-related deficits are an important phenotype in schizophrenia, we continue to build on this work in search of more detailed understanding of this complex phenomenon. For instance, we and collaborators have used dynamic causal modeling in conjunction with fMRI techniques to suggest a predominance of deficits in certain working memory subprocesses (i.e., updating/manipulating information) that appear particularly prominent in individuals with greater delusion symptom severity (Greenman et al., 2021). In healthy volunteers, this same signature is found in those with greater polygenic risk for schizophrenia.  We have also engaged in work aimed at understanding key cognitive developmental phenotypes in schizophrenia. In one recent investigation in a large schizophrenia sample, we sought to identify and characterize subgroups with different trajectories of early cognitive development, and then to profile the subgroups across four polygenic score dimensions. Premorbid and current IQ were used as inputs in cluster analyses and three cognitive trajectory subgroups were derived  pre-adolescent impairment, adolescent decline, and cognitively stable  with very different cognitive, clinical and functional characteristics. Separate polygenic scores were derived in our sample representing schizophrenia genetics, cognition genetics, education genetics, and ADHD genetics, and profiles of these four genetic scores were likewise quite different across trajectory subgroups. There was a striking convergence of subgroup differences in illness progression and clinical outcomes with subgroup profiles across polygenic score dimensions. Those who remained cognitive stable through adolescence only differed from controls on schizophrenia genetics. Those with an adolescent decline in cognition and more severe adult symptoms had the highest schizophrenia genetics and disadvantageous cognitive genetics. The subgroup whose members showed pre-adolescent impairment in cognitive and academic performance, and poor adult outcome, also had the most generalized, disadvantageous genetic profile relative to controls (Dickinson et al., 2020). Furthermore, in collaborative meta-analytic studies, we have helped find that individuals with metabolic syndrome, diabetes or hypertension are in fact at greater risk for cognitive impairment (Hagi et al., 2021). Understanding molecular, genetic and environmental pathways to schizophrenia is another important focus for this project. In light of epidemiological findings of association between obstetric/perinatal complications and schizophrenia risk, we have previously shown that such complications interact with hypoxia-responsive schizophrenia risk genes to affect illness risk. Along with collaborators, we have greatly advanced this work to show that the cumulative effect of the most strongly associated schizophrenia genetic risk loci is greatly amplified in patients with a history of obstetric/perinatal complications. In studies incorporating cortical interneurons generated from induced pluripotent stem cells derived from our patient cohorts, we have worked with a team of scientists to identify that such cells show synaptic density and arborization aberrancies in line with concurrent dysregulated expression of protocadherin genes and improved with PKC an enzyme in the protocadherin pathway inhibition. This exciting work points to novel developmental mechanisms in schizophrenia pathogenesis and merits further investigation.Ongoing work in these directions will prove important for refining models of illness and antipsychotic treatment and will inform therapeutic targeting.This work involves the following studies: NCT00942981, NCT00001258, NCT00024622, NCT00004571, NCT00001247,NCT00001486, NCT00044083, NCT00057707","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

Furthermore, this deep phenotyping approach permits investigation of multidimensional features (i.e., complex phenotypes) in a manner not otherwise feasible.In addition to these studies, an appreciation for the dynamic nature of these features, both over the course of development and under changing hormonal milieus, has motivated two lines of inquiry in collaboration with the Behavioral Endocrinology Branch employing incisive longitudinal designs. First, we are engaged in an extensive on-going longitudinal MRI and endocrinological study of children and adolescents, all carefully assessed for pubertal development, aimed at refining our knowledge of developmental trajectories and neural maturation by gene interaction effects on illness-related circuitry. This work, which involves longitudinal assessment of children every nine months from the time they are eight years old until they are 18, will be critical in understanding neurodevelopmental periods vulnerable to illness emergence. Second, we have used multimodal imaging to assess the neural effects of ovarian steroid hormones in women undergoing a 6-month hormone manipulation protocol involving ovarian suppression and individually replaced estrogen and progesterone. These data may be particularly informative in light of well-established epidemiological and clinical evidence for sex differences in neuropsychiatric illness onsets, presentations, and courses, as well as conditions directly linked with hormone fluctuations (e.g., premenstrual dysphoric disorder and post-partum psychosis), as mechanisms underlying these conditions remain unclear.This work involves the following studies: NCT00942981, NCT00001258, NCT00024622, NCT00004571, NCT00001486","The Clinical and Translational Neuroscience Branch continues to make advances on several fronts to delineate the neurochemical, neurogenetic, and neuropsychological contributions to neural systems function and development relevant to mental illness. We have devoted extensive efforts building two unprecedented scientific resources: first, a unique multimodal neuroimaging dataset in adults that includes neuropsychological testing, extensive dopaminergic PET imaging as well as functional and structural MRI; and, second, a longitudinal, neurodevelopmental dataset in children that incorporates structural and functional magnetic resonance-based brain imaging, neuropsychological measures, and, in conjunction with the Section on Behavioral Endocrinology, precise, state-of-the-art endocrinological measurements of pubertal status. In addition, we have engaged in novel imaging experiments assessing the neural effects of ovarian steroid hormones in women with and without premenstrual dysphoric disorder.  Recent progress has focused on dissecting genetic, neurochemical and hormonal contributions to cognitive functions and neural circuits that are implicated in neuropsychiatric illness and also show substantial variation over the lifespan and across individuals even in health. In our adult studies, we and collaborators meta-analyzed results from two recent genome-wide association studies, which identified numerous loci in the genome that have statistically reliable associations to cognitive performance. By implicating important biological pathways for cognition and establishing a basis for quantification of cumulative polygenic cognitive scoring that may further drive discovery in independent cohorts, this work has been an important step for the field. Building on this discovery, we employed several complementary transcriptomic methods to identify genes in these loci that are credibly associated with cognition and further annotate the resulting genes using multiple databases to identify druggable targets. Using a meta-analytic data set (N=373,617), we identified 241 independent cognition-associated loci (29 novel), and 76 genes were identified by two or more methods of gene identification. Several novel pathways were recognized that could be targeted via drug repurposing. Leveraging our transcriptomic and chemoinformatic databases, we identified 16 putative genes targeted by existing drugs potentially available for cognitive repurposing.  (Lam et al., 2021).In our longitudinal neurodevelopmental and endocrinological studies of children from age eight to 18, much of our focus in the past year has been on data collection. In this project (Cole et al., 2021), our extensive battery of imaging, cognitive, and hormonal measurements allows us to investigate endocrine-driven trajectories of neurobiological development in a comprehensive manner that will permit not only a more integrated view of puberty in the human brain than is currently available, but also will provide an unprecedented opportunity to trace the natural course and endocrinological dependence of key neuroimaging phenotypes established (by us and others) to be perturbed in neuropsychiatric illness.  Additionally, during this time, we have developed and provided to the scientific community analytical methods and tools to facilitate sophisticated non-linear mixed-effects modeling approaches to the dataset once complete (Chen et al. 2021). In addition to our work with the pubertal transition dataset, we continue to further our efforts toward understanding hormonal contributions to cognitive operations in adult women.  To this end we have completed a series of studies identifying an important neuroanatomical hub for regulating affective state in women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) compared with healthy women. These studies employed a rigorous hormone manipulation protocol involving leuprolide acetate induced ovarian suppression and add-back conditions with estrogen and progesterone separately. This work revealed that in women with PMDD, the subgenual cingulate cortex, an important affective regulatory region that is a treatment target in major depression, showed abnormal reductions in resting regional cerebral blood flow, measured by PET, during both estradiol and progesterone add-back conditions relative to ovarian suppression (Wei et al. 2021).  Data such as these may add to a better understanding of complex, hormonally-related changes in brain function in health and disease.","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

Most amnesic patients have a good short-term memory and can create long-term memories for skills and perceptual learning. Amnesia is global in its involvement of all domains of associative knowledge, for both facts (semantic memory) and events (episodic memory), dense in its severity, and anterograde in that the most dramatic effects involve new memories as opposed to old (pre-surgical or premorbid) ones. This memory impairment has a profound impact on activities of daily life, rendering patients unable to develop the feeling of a coherent, unified life experience. The overall goal of this project is to understand how information about facts and events is stored in the brain and the way in which brain structures work together to subserve memory. The specific objective of this project, accordingly, is to identify the precise brain structures that contribute to stimulus recognition and rapidly formed associative memories.","The hippocampus and perirhinal cortex are both broadly implicated in memory; nevertheless, their relative contributions to visual item recognition and location memory remain disputed. Neuropsychological studies that experimentally damage medial temporal lobe structures report various levels of memory impairmentranging from minor deficits to profound amnesia. The discrepancies in published findings have complicated efforts to determine the exact magnitude of visual item recognition and location memory impairments following damage to the hippocampus and/or perirhinal cortex. To provide the most accurate estimate to date of the overall effect size, we use meta-analytic techniques on data aggregated from 26 publications that assess visual item recognition and/or location memory in animals with and without selective neurotoxic lesions of the hippocampus or perirhinal cortex. We estimated the overall effect size, evaluated the relation between lesion extent and effect size, and investigated factors that may account for between-study variation. Grouping studies by lesion target and testing method, separate meta-analyses indicated that perirhinal cortex damage produced the largest impairment on tests of visual item recognition; by contrast, hippocampal damage produced the largest impairment on the subset of location memory tests that relied on spatial navigation. For the most part, meta-regressions indicated that greater impairment corresponds with greater lesion extent; paradoxically, however, hippocampal lesions predicted smaller impairments on tests of visual item recognition. We conclude the perirhinal cortex makes a larger contribution than the hippocampus to visual item recognition, and the hippocampus predominately contributes to spatial navigation.",There were no publications during this reporting period,"[('Christopher Ian Baker, PhD Section on Learning and Plasticity', 'Section on Learning and Plasticity'), ('Cibu Paul Thomas Laboratory of Brain and Cognition', 'Laboratory of Brain and Cognition')]",,

We are particularly interested in understanding how these neurocognitive measures predict treatment outcome. Thus, in one aspect of this project, we will test the hypothesis that children and adolescents with anxiety disorders exhibit perturbed neural responses when confronted with emotionally evocative stimuli. In a second aspect of this protocol, we will evaluate the efficacy of new treatments and test the degree to which brain function before treatment predicts a patient's response to treatment.","This work is conducted under protocol 01-M-0192, NCT00018057.We are using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine neurocognitive correlates of pediatric anxiety disorders and comparing findings in these syndromes with findings in adult anxiety disorders as well as in other pediatric mental disorders, particularly mood disorders. While studies conducted at the NIH as part of this protocol focus most narrowly and deeply on pediatric anxiety disorders, studies conducted with collaborators focus most deeply on adult anxiety disorders and mood or other psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents. Collaborative work therefore allows us to examine the similarities and differences between pediatric and adult mood and anxiety disorders.The current protocol has generated key insights on novel treatments, which are now being studied in the context of brain-imaging research. The protocol also focuses deeply on the manner in which effective treatment changes neural correlates, so that research on novel therapeutics might target such neural correlates.The work performed under this protocol and with the many associated collaborators holds the potential to dramatically impact public health, for various reasons. Mood and anxiety disorder dramatically alter the well-being of children and adolescents. Nevertheless, relatively little work has been conducted on the underlying pathophysiology of these conditions, using methods that allow direct extensions to work in basic neuroscience. fMRI research is vital for work in this area. Such research assesses brain function in children using methods that are directly comparable to the techniques used to study brain function in animal models.There is a particularly pressing need to Using understandings from neuroscience to generate new ideas about treatment, work in this protocol holds the hope of generating these insights in ways that will lead to novel treatment discovery.For example, replicable perturbations, identified through the confluence of findings in animal models and children, might be targeted by novel treatments. In the current protocol, such work has focused on extinction as it relates to cognitive behavioral therapy, and on attention bias as it relates to both cognitive behavioral therapy and cognitive training. As such, this protocol defines a promising pathway for generating treatments that may alter clinical practice. In the past five years, we have published multiple papers that demonstrate such promise by targeting aspects of attention and plasticity in fear responses, extending research completed in prior years. Two randomized controlled trials were published in this area through work with collaborators and following on from highly similar randomized controlled trials published in prior years.For work completed at the NIH, we target randomized controlled trials where data are acquired from brain imaging. We have enrolled 95 patients from a trial that will finish when we have reached 120 patients. Enrollment did  stall with the COVID-19 pandemic.  Moreover, while we began to recruit participants in the fall, it was not until the spring that enrollment began to approach pre-pandemic levels.  Once this trial finishes, we will be able to connect a measure of brain function directly to a measure of treatment response, one very important potential breakthrough that is directly relevant to patient care. As such, this protocol demonstrates the potential importance of embedding a clinical trial within a brain imaging study.The central focus of the protocol is on individual differences in neural circuitry function, as they relate to individual differences in behavior and clinical response to treatment. Replicated findings from this project clearly implicate many such deficits in anxiety, moving research on developmental psychopathology into the domain of neuroscience. Particularly exciting work from the past year focuses on aspects of threat learning, including both conditioning and extinction. This work extends basic research on plasticity in ways that carry relevance for novel therapeutics. Moreover, a major  paper that emerged from the protocol in the past year was able to replicate key findings on the neural circuitry of anxiety both in NIMH patients and in a large extramural data set.  Together, the two samples contained more than 500 individuals.  The main finding in the paper was to show that neural circuitry specifically related to anxiety could be differentiated from the neural circuitry that anxiety shares with other forms of psychopathology, such as irritability or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.  Prior neuropsychological studies in children as well as in adults note that mood and anxiety disorders are associated with deficits in attention modulation and emotional memory. We have found consistent evidence of such deficits in the current protocol. Moreover, prior imaging studies in healthy adults show that tasks requiring attention modulation or emotional memory engage cortico-limbic brain regions previously implicated in adult mood and anxiety disorders. These regions include the amygdala, ventral prefrontal cortex, cingulate gyrus, and hippocampus. Once again, we also find such evidence in the current set of projects, with multiple, replicated reports of cortico-limbic dysfunction in both pediatric and adult anxiety disorders. This shows that fMRI attention modulation and emotional memory paradigms differentially engage cortico-limbic brain regions in psychiatrically healthy and anxious, impaired participants. These studies are ongoing in more than 750 participants. For these participants, each received neurocognitive examinations, and a subset received fMRI examinations. Each also received standardized assessments of response to treatment. This has allowed our group to use our data as part of international collaborations, where our group is playing an increasingly large role. As part of our studies in healthy individuals, we also successfully developed each of the fMRI protocols that will be used in the current project. We have a particularly strong interest in studying reliability of brain function, as assessed with fMRI. In recent years, we have been able to develop paradigms with acceptable levels of reliability. In the past two years, we used such paradigms to focus our work in patients on brain functions that we have found to be reliable. We published a particularly important paper on this issue in the past year. Such work is highly important, since treatment-related brain imaging research benefits greatly from the ability to identify reliable perturbations in brain function among patients. As noted above, using these methods, many of our initial hypotheses have been confirmed, and our studies are now moving forward to examine issues of specificity and to consider how our findings might be used to inform advances in treatment. This focus has led to the creation of large-scale collaborations. This collaboration is supported by an extramural grant that allows Vanderbilt University and the University of Wisconsin to work with our NIMH site to attempt to replicate findings across our three groups. This will generate data in approximately 500 young people on the biology of anxiety, as delineated in our work over the past 15 years. These efforts have already generated a series of important publications.During the coming year, we will devote most of our time to building on the successes of our past work. This includes completing our study of novel treatment and preparing for the trial that will extend the results from this study.","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

Risk is defined based on one of two indices: exposure to stressful social or medical experiences; extreme temperament during early childhood. The series of projects in this research program expose children and adolescents varying in one of these two domains to emotionally evocative experiences in the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner. These studies test the hypothesis that risk for mood and anxiety disorders manifests in the neural response to emotionally evocative experiences. Specifically, risk is hypothesized to manifest in an abnormal response in the amygdala, striatum, and ventral prefrontal cortex.","This work is conducted under protocol 03-M-0186, NCT00060775.In this project, our group is examining biological aspects of risk for mood and anxiety disorders in children. Such work has major public impact. By identifying biological risks in children, information on novel treatments and preventative interventions will emerge. Given the understanding of most chronic mental illnesses as developmental disorders, such information holds the hope of dramatically influencing the mental well-being of many individuals.This project encompasses work examining the degree to which neurocognitive profiles vary among children and adolescents stratified with respect to risk factors for mood and anxiety disorders. For these studies, personal history is defined based on early-childhood temperament. In a second protocol, we are acquiring fMRI data from a subset of these individuals. We have expanded our efforts in these protocols to encompass studies in juveniles across the full span of infancy, childhood, and adolescence. Thus, one set of studies is based among young adults who have been prospectively followed for more than two decades. A second set of studies is based in school-aged children who are now approaching adolescence. In both sets of studies, as well as the larger series of studies in this project, considerable progress continues to be made. A third set of studies examines infants. This set of studies has grown particularly rapidly in the past three years. Data collection activities during infancy is highly active. Across the two sets of cohorts, this project seeks to achieve a lifespan developmental perspective throughout the entire period of maturation.Studies on temperamental risk continue to dominate activities during the past year, as they had in the few years immediately prior. Thus, in this past year, studies on temperament occupy approximately 90% of all resources devoted to research on risk. During the past four years, we spent approximately half of our efforts on collecting data in a childhood cohort, where the participants are now approximately 19 years old. The other major component of our effort examines individuals who are in their late 20s. For the last three years, our work in these cohorts consistently replicates findings across cohorts. We demonstrate the persistent influence of temperament on risk into for psychopathology. In this past year, we have identified important neurocognitive factors that isolate subsets of children with particular temperaments who face the greatest risk for psychopathology. This has generated a steady stream of brain-imaging papers. A particularly important paper utilized longitudinal data to document changes in brain function occurring in tandem with changes in symptoms of anxiety and depression. This paper, appearing in a high-impact journal, spanned more than 20 years of research. Another particularly important paper shows that the response to errors predicts high risk for anxiety and depression.  These findings are similar to results in patients seen in other work. As a result, these findings could impact thoughts about prevention.  In comparing risk factors for behavioral and emotional problems, other questions relate to the identification of factors that differentiate among children who are at high risk yet remain resilient from those who are at risk but manifest problems. Still other questions focus on different psychiatric outcomes from particular temperaments. Work has been particularly active in infants, where we are working with our collaborators at the University of Maryland. To date data has been collected in nearly 100 infants and we have collaborated on two extramural grants.Our most in-depth studies focus on the temperament of ""behavioral inhibition."" This work is made possible through our strong collaborative relationship with Dr. Nathan Fox at the University of Maryland. Our studies in this area continued to grow and expand this year, as they had done in the immediately prior years. Dr. Fox has followed cohorts of approximately 600 infants as they passed though childhood. These children have received repeated assessments of their temperament. Temperament classifications in the sample during infancy and early childhood have been shown to predict behavior later in life. We have also completed a series of investigations in this sample. Results from these studies support the conclusions generated in other research within our group. Namely, this work establishes the presence of strong, consistent associations between the presence of and risk factors for mental illness in children and the presence of perturbed brain function.In the past year, our group continued to have significant success in charting relationships between temperament and brain function across a broad age range. We continue to publish widely in this area, having published more than 10 papers in this area during the past year. In fact, due to restrictions from the pandemic, major efforts went into publication and preparation of manuscripts following completion of data analysis. This included two publications examining associations with pandemic-related stress from children in this project. During the next year, we plan to increase our efforts devoted to data acquisition, as activities increase related to reduced restrictions in many communities. This will involve efforts  in all three cohorts, including infants and adults across their 20s and into their 30sOverall, the results from these studies show that the seeds of temperament continue to be expressed throughout development. Behaviorally, these seeds are expressed in measures of task performance and signs of psychopathology. From a brain-function perspective, these seeds are expressed in measures of electrophysiology and fMRI. Moreover, these measures of brain function mediate and moderate the relationships between temperament and psychopathology. As such, the studies provide important information on understanding risk for psychopathology.","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

Our ultimate goals are to advance multimodal neuroimaging both to gain insight about the brain and to contribute to health care approaches.Towards these goals, our research has been carried out in two primary projects and several less over-reaching stand-alone projects. The first is ultra-high field fMRI that explores functional organization at the level of cortical layers. The aim of this project is to bridge the gap between human brain mapping and invasive electrical and cellular recordings in animal models. Imaging at the level of layers potentially opens up a plethora of novel directional connectivity information as they are typically organized into output and input layers, thus allowing differentiation of output signal related activity from input signal related activity. Mapping of these hierarchies promises to clarify top-down vs bottom-up processing and integration. The second is the leveraging of more subtle, information-rich, and dynamic signals from the fMRI time series using a coordinated development of an array of brain activation strategies and advanced processing methods. For example, naturalistic stimuli more fully engage a wider range of cortical regions, yet because of their complexity, defy simple processing methods.","Protocol number 93-M-0170, NCT00001360Ultra high-resolution fMRI:With increased availability of ultra-high field (7T) human MRI scanners, fMRI spatial resolution has been pushed to the sub-millimeter domain, making it possible to resolve functional activity and connectivity across cortical depths/layers. However, despite promising potentials, the widespread application of layer fMRI in humans is tempered by limited functional resolution caused by sensitivity to larger vessels and misregistration of functional to anatomic scans caused by different pulse sequences for each. To address large vessel bias in BOLD, Dr. Yuhui Chai, a post doc in our group, developed an approach called VAPER which has shown more sensitivity to capillaries. To address the second limitation, Dr. Chai, developed a magnetization transfer weighted anatomical EPI imaging technique to allow layer analysis in native fMRI space (MT-3D-EPI), as the most accurate way to define cortical depth, obviating the need for distortion correction and registration.Application of layer fMRI:Multisensory interplay can occur in areas that are considered unisensory, such as planum temporale (PT). Dr. Chai found a division of function between visual and auditory processing in PT and distinct feedback mechanisms in different subareas. Specifically, anterior PT was activated more by auditory inputs and received feedback modulation in superficial layers, and this feedback is likely arising from top-down influences from higher-order multimodal areas. In contrast, posterior PT was preferentially activated by visual inputs and received visual feedback in both superficial and deep layers, which is likely projected directly from the early visual cortex. To our knowledge, this is the first time that sensory-specific influence in human PT was able to be delineated over the dimensions of columnar distance and laminar depth.Line scanning: In addition to imaging layer activity at 7T, we have been also working on what is known as line scanning, which adapts previous work in rodents to humans, allowing us to simultaneously achieve high spatial (200 m) and temporal resolution (100 ms) by limiting acquisition to a very small patch of cortex. The aim of this development project is to better bridge the spatiotemporal gap between human and animal cortical layer research, thus allowing for the investigation of very dynamic layer signals in cognitive tasks typically confined to human experiments. Further, the increased spatiotemporal resolution of the method lends itself to vascular modeling that can inform other depth/layer-dependent acquisition methods.Assessing and interpreting time-varying changes in fMRI signal:Recent years have seen an explosion of studies looking at time-varying aspects of functional connectivity during resting-state. These studies suggest that those temporal variations (in the orders of tens of seconds) in functional connectivity might be relevant to our understanding of healthy and diseased brain function. Yet, other studies have demonstrated that shifts in vigilance and wakefulness levels that occur as resting-state progresses can also similarly affect functional connectivity. Unfortunately, wakefulness is rarely monitored due to the need for additional concurrent recordings (e.g., eye tracking, EEG); and novel methods able to provide insights about fluctuations in wakefulness using fMRI-only data are in great demand. Recently it was reported that strong fluctuations around 0.05Hz, hypothesized to be CSF inflow, appear in the fourth ventricle (FV) when subjects fall asleep. The analysis of this slow signal could provide an easy way to evaluate wakefulness in fMRI-only data. In this project, we used the 7T resting-state sample from the Human Connectome Project, which contains eye tracking recordings that can be used to detect long periods of eye closures.  Our results confirm the presence of those fluctuations in drowsy subjects, despite this data having relatively small inflow weighting. We also show that fluctuations of a similar frequency appear in large portions of grey matter with different temporal delays, and that they can substantially influence estimates of functional connectivity. Finally, we show that the temporal evolution of this signal cannot only help us reproduce previously reported overall sleep patterns in resting-state data, but also predict individual periods of eye closure with 70% accuracy, matching predictions attainable using the amplitude of the global signal (a common fMRI marker of arousal). In this manner our results demonstrate the presence of this signal in a large, publicly available fMRI sample, and its value as a marker of arousal in absence of a better metric. Dimensionality reduction of time series data:Over this year, Javier Gonzalez-Castillo and a post-bac IRTA, Isabel Fernandez,  have been working on applying manifold learning techniques to dynamic functional connectivity data. We know that the cognitive states of our brain are in constant fluctuation, and we hope to develop methods that reliably capture the relationship between those states and fMRI data, so that we can better explore the neuronal correlates of spontaneous thought. In collaboration with the Machine Learning Team, we are currently exploring how model hyperparameters affect final low dimensional representations of dynamic functional connectivity data, and how such differences may affect interpretation. As an example, we are determining what the optimal dimensionality is for exploring fMRI data, and how dimensionality may vary with external task demands. As we move forward, we hope to generate a set of guidelines and heuristics that will help the neuroimaging community adopt these novel methods and apply them to the analysis and interpretation of resting state dynamics. Multi-echo fMRIWe have also continued work on improving multi-echo fMRI, particularly processing of multi-echo fMRI data using tedana (TE dependent data analysis) open source software (http://tedana.readthedocs.io). This has included recent work making the software more robust, understandable, and modifiable for future improvements. We have submitted for publication a manuscript on TE-dependent analysis of multi-echo fMRI with tedana, which is under review at the Journal of Open Science Software.Comparison of fMRI with dynamic calcium imaging:Lastly, we continue to work as a co-investigators on a BRAIN grant with Elizabeth Hillman of Columbia University. We are examining wide field optical mapping data in mice using fMRI-style connectivity analysis methods. This work is helping validate fMRI approaches to connectivity analyses using invasive methods that include both calcium imaging and hemodynamic measures that are more similar to BOLD. Some of this work was presented at the BRAIN Investigators Meeting in June 2021 and it was submitted as an abstract to present at SFN 2021.","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

Most neurons in the mammalian brain are generated before birth and are never added to or replaced after this time. However, specific populations of neurons in some brain regions, notably the hippocampus, continue to be generated throughout adulthood. By determining how environmental factors and experiences affect the production of new neurons, how neurons born during development and during adulthood differ, and what types of behavioral changes occur when neurogenesis is inhibited or enhanced, we hope to better understand the normal function of new neurons as well as their role in pathological conditions including mood disorders.","This project focuses on the interactions between experience and adult neurogenesis in the hippocampal region of the brain. We are interested in understanding how experiences, including positive and stressful experiences, regulate adult neurogenesis and how the new neurons alter behavior in different situations. We study the regulation and function of adult neurogenesis in rats and mice, which show continued production of new neurons throughout adulthood similar to that in primates, including humans. The hippocampus is thought to play an important role in spatial learning and memory, but many spatial tests for rodents are also stressful, making it difficult to determine whether any changes in behavior are due to effects on spatial abilities or stress response. We developed a labyrinth maze and tested rats abilities to navigate through the maze to earn a food reward. Several different configurations of the maze were tested in order to ask whether new neurons were important for decreasing interference between memories for different paths. We compared normal rats with transgenic rats that we developed to allow us to specifically inhibit neurogenesis in adulthood. We found that rats lacking adult neurogenesis learned the mazes as well as the control rats and remembered the correct paths for several weeks. In one maze configuration, rats without new neurons performed much better than the controls, which we determined through further testing was due to the presence of an aversive odor (peppermint) in the maze that distracted the rats from the task only if they had ongoing adult neurogenesis. This finding suggests that new neurons are not necessary for non-stressful spatial learning but that they play an important role in determining whether animals focus on a task or attend to background stimuli. We also investigated the effects of sedatives on the birth and survival of new neurons in the adult hippocampus. We found that sedation itself had no effect on adult neurogenesis, but specific sedatives altered cell proliferation or cell survival, suggesting that decreased neurogenesis in the young adult DG could potentially mediate some of the effects of sedation on cognitive function.","Ordered by reference within the summary, then by publication type and author name.

The primary goal of this study is to identify brain mechanisms mediating the pathophysiology of severe irritability to ultimately guide the development of such treatments.Severe pediatric irritability a very common problem, yet relatively little brain-based research has been devoted to it. Studies on the accompanying symptoms and course of irritability, as well as brain mechanisms, are timely and important. Irritability is a dimension present across the population, so its study fits well into the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative. Further, also consistent with RDoC, irritability is one of the most important transdiagnostic symptoms in youth. It is important to determine the extent to which the brain mechanisms mediating irritability vary across diagnoses; such knowledge would inform the development and application of personalized treatments. For this reason, many of our studies include not only youth with severe irritability (i.e., those with DSM-5 Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD)) and healthy subjects, but also those with anxiety or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Youth with these illnesses often exhibit significant irritability and they are also important comparison subjects for our severely irritable youth. Since abnormal responses to frustration are an important component of irritability, the RDoC construct of frustrative non-reward provides a ready translational bridge from animal to human work, increasing the possibility of identifying causative brain mechanisms.This work has had major public health impact. At the time that the work began, severely irritable youth were often diagnosed as having bipolar disorder and treated with medications indicated for that illness, without evidence as to whether these are effective or the least toxic alternatives available. Our early work demonstrated that the bipolar disorder formulation was incorrect. Importantly, the prognosis of bipolar disorder is different from that of severe irritability, which is longitudinally associated with unipolar depression and anxiety. Further, the differentiation of irritability from bipolar disorder led to the testing of medications with less toxicity as well as psychotherapeutic interventions. Psychotherapeutic clinical trials in youth with severe irritability are being conducted under 15-M-0182 (NCT02531893); PI: Brotman. In contrast, the work in the project described below, conducted under protocol 02-M-0021 (NCT00025935), focuses on identifying pathophysiological mechanisms that mediate severe irritability. Such work will provide groundwork for future treatment efforts while also providing basic knowledge about the brain dysfunction underlying this important clinical symptom, as well as related illnesses such as anxiety and ADHD.","Given concerns about the appropriate diagnosis for children with chronic, severe irritability, we characterized such youth; this work formed the basis for the new diagnosis of mood dysregulation disorder with dysphoria (DMDD) in DSM-5. Since the inception of this project (ZIA MH002786-17), approximately 600 highly irritable youth have enrolled, along with more than 200 youth with ADHD. (Many DMDD patients have ADHD, and youth with ADHD tend to have less irritability than those with DMDD but more than healthy youth; hence they are an appropriate comparison group.) Approximately 50 new patients were recruited this year.Youth with DMDD suffer severe impairment, in terms of medications received, hospitalizations, and standardized measures of function. Irritability is one of the most common psychiatric symptoms in children, but there has been little brain-based research on it, and there are few evidence-based treatments. In 2017-18, we articulated a testable, heuristic, translational model of irritability that continues to guide our research. The model posits that core deficits in pediatric irritability include aberrant responses to frustration and aberrant approach responses to threat. Aberrant responses to frustration implicate reward learning circuitry dysfunction e.g., instrumental learning deficits that prevent adaptation to changing environmental contingencies, or exaggerated prediction error responses to the omission of an expected reward. Since the original formulation of the model, we have updated it to include evidence suggesting that cognitive control deficits (specifically, deficient inhibitory control) may contribute to maladaptive behavior in response to either frustration or threat.Irritability is well-suited for the transdiagnostic, translational approach of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC). We characterize irritability as a continuous variable, in DMDD and other groups i.e., anxiety disorders, ADHD. We use frustrating tasks during neuroimaging, since a hallmark of irritability is difficulty tolerating frustration. In a manuscript published in 2019, we used an fMRI frustration paradigm (the affective Posner task) to study 195 youth with DMDD, ADHD, and/or anxiety disorders, as well as healthy youth. We found that irritability is associated with increased prefrontal and striatal engagement when youth attempt an attention orienting task after receiving frustrating feedback. Our plan was to replicate and extend this finding by scanning a new sample of youth with the affective Posner task while also acquiring resting state functional connectivity data immediately before and after the task. This design allows us to study behavioral and neural adaptations during and after frustration, and to test associations between these adaptations and irritability. Thus, we study frustration as a dynamic, evolving, whole-brain network process. While we were not able to scan subjects this year because of the pandemic, we were able to analyze data acquired pre-pandemic in 66 youth. Of note, we also analyzed data acquired pre-pandemic in 50 youth scanned on a second frustration task, the Change task, again with pre- and post-task resting state data. The Change task differs from the affective Posner in the timing of frustration (short blocks of frustration, interspersed randomly with non-frustrating blocks, vs. a long block of non-frustration followed by a long bout of frustration) and in the cognitive task (cognitive flexibility vs. attention orienting). In addition to analyzing the new Change data, this year we published an older study using the Change task that included data from 69 youth with DMDD, anxiety, ADHD or healthy volunteers. In the published study, we used connectome-based predictive modeling, a machine learning approach, to identify networks predicting irritability. Connectivity during frustration (but not non-frustration) blocks predicted child-reported irritability. To analyze data from the two studies using a frustration task (either affective Posner or change) flanked by pre- and post-resting state data, we used a graph theoretical approach. The latter assumes that the brain is organized into complex subnetworks (modules) of brain regions (nodes). When the clustering of nodes into modules changes, network reconfiguration occurs. Two findings emerge from both studies, despite the use of different tasks. First, network reconfiguration occurs during and after frustration, with reconfiguration of frontal-temporal-limbic and fronto-parietal networks being most prominent. Second, the global efficiency (Eglob) of modules formed during and after the paradigm may predict irritability. Eglob indexes the capacity to exchange information among all regions of a network. Both find that Eglob in modules present during resting-state after frustration predicts irritability, highlighting the potential clinical relevance of the post-frustration period. In addition to the affective Posner and change paradigms, we use a third frustration task. This task, Carnival, was designed to test whether irritability is associated with reinforcement learning deficits at baseline and after frustration. Reinforcement learning is the process by which people learn what behaviors will be rewarded. Deficits in such learning could lead to increased frustration in irritable youth. One component of reinforcement learning is prediction error processing i.e., brain signaling indicating a mismatch between an expected and a received reward. Pre-pandemic, we piloted this task in 34 youth in the scanner and obtained both the expected frustration and expected brain activation associated with prediction error processing. If irritability is associated with instrumental learning deficits, this would have direct treatment implications.Our translational model posits that aberrant responses to both threat and frustration are important core mechanisms in irritability. Therefore, we were interested in investigating associations among brain networks mediating these two psychological processes. This year we analyzed data in 307 youth (DMDD, anxiety, ADHD, healthy) who completed a threat-attention task and/or the affective Posner frustration task. We used canonical correlation analysis to integrate brain activity during these two separate fMRI tasks. We found that activity in networks mediating frustration and threat were significantly correlated but largely anatomically distinct. We also found associations between parent-rated irritability and activity on the AP task in default mode and motor networks. This work is being prepared for publication. Our increased recruitment of youth with ADHD over the past two years has also allowed us to begin to examine in more depth the phenomenology and pathophysiology of irritability occurring in the context of ADHD. In a study we published this year, 489 youth with DMDD, subclinical irritability, anxiety, ADHD, or no diagnosis, high levels of ADHD symptoms were associated with increased rates of phasic irritability (temper outbursts and aggression) but not tonic irritability (irritable mood between outbursts). Further evidence of external validity for the distinction between phasic and tonic irritability could have important treatment implications.","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

A major premise in modern psychiatry is that dysfunctions in brain proteins underlie many neuropsychiatric disorders. Each new radiotracer that we develop is designed to report on the status of a specific biochemical process (e.g., neurotransmission) or a specific protein target (e.g., enzyme, neurotransmitter receptor, transporter, or plaque) within the living human brain, and in some cases on how this protein may be acted upon or affected by established or experimental drugs.The development of novel PET radiotracers is an ambitious and challenging field of research, requiring immense basic effort at the levels of medicinal chemistry, pharmacology, and rapid radiochemistry with very short-lived radioisotopes (i.e., carbon-11 and fluorine-18 that have half-lives of 20 and 110 min, respectively). These efforts are augmented with important contributions from other imaging sciences (e.g., biology, medicine, physics, biomathematical modeling). In our laboratory, the PET Radiopharmaceutical Sciences Section (PRSS) of the Molecular Imaging Branch (MIB), this effort is approached through research in organic and medicinal chemistry, radiochemistry, and radio-bioanalytical techniques. Our research program closely interacts with the Section on PET Neuroimaging Sciences in our Branch for effective novel radiotracer evaluation in animals and human subjects. We also collaborate within NIMH and NIH, and with national and international academic centers, and with Pharma. The new information to be gained on the living brain through these efforts on new radiotracer development is inaccessible by other means: the application of radiotracers with PET provides unique windows into specific aspects of the normal and dysfunctional molecular workings of the living human brain.The short half-lives of carbon-11 and fluorine-18 demand methodological advances for their efficient incorporation into new radiotracers at specific molecular sites. An important part of our laboratory's remit is therefore to develop and apply such methodology for the purpose of providing a strong foundation for PET radiotracer development. Moreover, the short half-lives of carbon-11 and fluorine-18 demand radiotracers to be produced rapidly for each PET imaging experiment performed in an animal or human subject. Our Section produces a wide range of such radiotracers on a regular basis. We are also engaged in studies of radiotracer metabolism to deepen our understanding of radiotracer behavior and to provide rigorous radiotracer evaluation. Such studies also facilitate new radiotracer design.Ultimately, developments in this field may have an impact on the understanding, diagnosis and treatment of a wide variety of disorders (e.g., anxiety, autism, depression, Fragile X syndrome, drug addiction, stroke, traumatic brain injury and dementia).","The Molecular Imaging Branch aims to exploit positron emission tomography (PET) as an imaging technique for investigating neuropsychiatric disorders, such as depression, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's Disease. Fundamental to this mission is the development of novel radioactive probes (radiotracers) that can be used with PET to measure abnormal changes in critical brain proteins. Of particular interest are proteins that are suspected to have involvement in the progression of neuropsychiatric disorders, and which may become targets for new drugs or other therapeutic interventions. Such proteins include neuroreceptors, transporters, and enzymes. They mostly exist at low levels in brain.The development of new radiotracers is the key to exploiting the potential of PET in neuropsychiatric research. However, a successful PET radiotracer must satisfy a wide range of difficult-to-satisfy chemical, biochemical, and pharmacological criteria. Consequently, PET radiotracer development is highly challenging. In fact, our research has some parallels with drug discovery in that it entails high effort and heavy risk but can reap rich biomedical rewards. The number of potentially interesting PET imaging steadily increases and far exceeds the range of currently available radiotracers.Our laboratory, the PET Radiopharmaceutical Sciences Section, places a concerted effort on all chemical aspects of PET radiotracer discovery. We  are equipped for medicinal chemistry and automated radiochemistry with positron-emitting carbon-11 (t1/2 = 20 min) and fluorine-18 (t1/2 = 110 min). These short-lived radioisotopes are available to us daily from the cyclotrons of the NIH Clinical Center (Chief: Dr. P. Herscovitch). Our Section interacts seamlessly with our Branchs Section on PET Neuroimaging Sciences (Chief: Dr. R.B. Innis) for early evaluation of candidate PET radiotracers in biological models and in animals. Subsequent PET research in humans is also performed with the Imaging Section under Food and Drug Administration oversight through 'exploratory' or 'full' Investigational New Drug Applications. All radiotracer production for PET studies in humans is performed within the NIH Clinical Center current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) laboratory. A detailed example of this type of production for a carbon-11 labeled radiotracer has just been published by us in Nature Protocols.In the period covered by this report, we worked on developing PET radiotracers for several imaging targets. These include TSPO, the GluN2B sub-site of the NMDA receptor, orexin receptors, and certain enzymes (COX-1, COX-2, PDE1, and PDE4 B and D subtypes, RIPK-1, and OGA). In collaboration with Drs. Richmond (NIMH) and Michaelides (NIDA), we also started to explore PET radiotracer development in support of emerging chemogenetic tools and technology for interrogating brain function. One radiotracer that we had earlier developed for TSPO imaging (C-11PBR28) is now being applied by many PET imaging centers to investigate neuroinflammation in response to various neurological insults (e.g., stroke, epilepsy, and neurodegeneration). An early unexpected finding was that humans because of a genetic difference, carry either one or both of two distinct forms of TSPO and that these interact differently with C-11PBR28, complicating the analysis of PET studies. Consequently, we sought to develop genetically-insensitive TSPO radiotracers. One of our newer radiotracers, C-11ER176, can quantify TSPO in all subjects of identified genotype, and turns out to be one of the highest performing TSPO radiotracers. We are now producing C-11ER176 for clinical studies as are some other imaging centers. We are also developing longer-lived and therefore more broadly useful F-18 labeled versions of this radiotracer. Some of these show high promise in rodents and monkey, and one of these will be advanced to evaluation in healthy human subjects. We have been developing radiotracers for other targets relevant to the study of neuroinflammation, such as the cyclooxygenase (COX) subtype 1 and subtype 2 enzymes. The COXs are biochemical targets for well-known anti-inflammatory drugs, such as aspirin and ibuprofen. Very promising C-11 labeled radiotracers have emerged. Two of these (C-11PS13 for COX-1 and C-11PS13 for COX-2) show imaging efficacy in humans and are now entering clinical studies. These radiotracers may provide more biochemical specificity for investigation of neuroinflammation. They can also prove useful for the development of improved anti-inflammatory drugs. Furthermore, these radiotracers are being explored by collaborators at the University of Toronto for imaging and drug development application in oncology, with promising findings. We are continuing to work towards the development of radiotracers with higher sensitivity for imaging brain COX-2, and in addition longer-lived (F-18 labeled) radiotracers for both COX-1 and COX-2. We are also developing radiotracers for imaging other targets of interest for the study of neuroinflammation, such as mitochondrial colony stimulating factor-1 receptor and the kinase, RIPK-1.NMDA receptors are acted upon by one of the brains most important neurotransmitters for implementing normal brain function, namely glutamate. Perturbations in NMDA function are strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and some other disorders such as depression. Our research has led to initially promising radiotracers for imaging the GluN2B binding site on the NMDA receptor. We are continuing to evaluate these radiotracers for their imaging efficacies.PET radiotracers can provide important quantitative information on experimental therapeutics for neuropsychiatric disorders, such as ability to cross the blood-brain-barrier and to engage with a target protein. In collaborations with academia and Pharma, we have been developing several radiotracers for this purpose. These radiotracers are targeted at proteins that have not previously been imaged in living human brain and that may have eventual clinical research utility. These proteins include, with clinical interest in parentheses, the enzyme OGA (dementia) and subtypes of phosphodiesterase (depression, and cognitive function). Our radiotracer for imaging OGA was found to perform excellently in human subjects. The development of radiotracers for phosphodiesterase subtypes has shown some promise. One radiotracer for the PDE4D subtype performed quite well in non-human primate but less well in human. Alternatives with improved properties are now being developed through our own medicinal chemistry effort, and with continuing collaboration with Tetra Therapeutics. We are advancing methodology for improved radiotracer development. Thus, we have recently developed new agents for radiolabeling, notably C-11fluoroform,  F-18fluoroform, and C-11carbonyl difluoride. These expand chemical space for radiotracer development. Our  recent development of new TSPO radiotracers was in fact enabled through such parallel methodological advances. New methods for utilizing cyclotron-produced F-18fluoride ion and C-11carbon monoxide are being developed. These methodological advances are gradually entering into our radiotracer production program.The laboratory continues to be active in training new scientists at graduate and postdoctoral level for this expanding field.We produce some useful radiotracers that have been developed elsewhere for PET investigations in animal or human subjects e.g., C-11rolipram (for PDE4 enzyme imaging) and C-11UCBJ (for synaptic vesicle 2A receptor imaging). Each PET experiment requires a radiosynthesis of the radiotracer on the same day, and hence radiotracer production is a regular activity.","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

The purpose of our research is to develop probes that can be used to assess these chemical imbalances to better understand these disorders and, hopefully, improve their treatment.A major goal of the Molecular Imaging Branch is to develop new radiotracers and new imaging paradigms to study abnormal protein targets in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. The purpose of this research is to evaluate in vivo the pharmacokinetics, sensitivity, and reproducibility of brain imaging measurements of radiolabeled probes for use in positron emission tomography (PET). Animals are used to evaluate new tracers and new methods (e.g., combined with a pharmacological challenge) prior to their extension to human subjects. Testing of these tracers in animals prior to their extension to humans is essential to ensure the validity of the measurement as well as the safety of the procedures.","Nearly two decades ago, researchers discovered how to manipulate neuronal activity in vivo by engineering receptors to bind with specific small molecules, or ligands. This powerful new chemogenetic technology was dubbed Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs). In most DREADDs experiments, a specific neuronal population is virally transfected with a receptor that has been genetically modified to respond to a specific designer drug that, in turn, is designed to pass up endogenous receptors and react with DREADD receptors only. Once introduced, DREADDs can be used to excite or inhibit target neuronal populations. It is also possible to quantify the density and distribution of DREADDs in vivo using PET. Earlier work had found that the ligand 11Cdeschloroclozapine (11CDCZ) could penetrate the brain but that the prototypical DREADD agonist Clozapine N-oxide (CNO) could not, making 11CDCZ superior for translational neuroscience applications that use DREADDs. Our laboratory sought to precisely measure those features that made 11CDCZ a superior agonist for DREADD neuroscience applications.   To ensure the precision of our measurements, we quantified distinct PET signals from (1) transfected receptors, (2) endogenous receptors and targets, and (3) non-displaceable binding in other brain regions. 11CDCZ and 11CCLZ PET scans were taken two to 24 months after injecting a genetically modified muscarinic type-4 human receptor (hM4Di) into the right amygdala of a male rhesus macaque. The amount of hM4Di binding was derived by subtracting the parent radioligands baseline signal normalized to the concentration in arterial plasma (n = 3 scans/radioligand) from the concentration after receptor blockade (n = 3 scans/radioligand).As expected, both radioligands, which had comparable DREADD selectivity, showed greater uptake in the DREADD-transfected region; displaceable uptake was not uniformly distributed, perhaps representing off-target binding to endogenous receptor(s). After correction, 11CDCZ signal was 19% of that for 11CCLZ, and background uptake was 10% of that for 11CCLZ. Despite stronger 11CCLZ binding, the signal-to-background ratio for 11CDCZ was almost two-fold greater than for 11CCLZ. More significant was the fact that all reference tissue models for both radioligands underestimated the signal-to-background noise ratio in the transfected region by 40-50 percent. Together, the results indicate that the greater signal-to-background ratio of 11CDCZ was due to its lower background uptake, providing valuable information about why 11CDCZ works better than other radioligands for imaging the hM4Di DREADD.","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

Studying these interactions is extremely challenging due to the complex spatial organization of neurons and their temporally precise communication mediated by action potentials (APs). Therefore, insight into the mechanisms of brain functions requires the simultaneous monitoring of APs in large populations of well identified neurons. Importantly, the resulting large data sets need to be understood within a conceptual framework that allows for the accurate interpretation of normal and abnormal brain dynamics. Over the last 10 years, my laboratory has discovered such a framework, and defined the term 'neuronal avalanches'. We established that neuronal avalanches are the precise spatiotemporal organization of normal neuronal population activity at rest and during information processing in the awake animal.  Avalanches are scale-invariant in time, space, and group size. We published robust experimental evidence confirming the existence of neuronal avalanches in rodents, monkeys, and humans across different developmental states and experimental conditions. We established that avalanche dynamics optimize numerous aspects of information processing in cortical networks. Our long-term goal is to understand how the cortex maintains and regulates neuronal avalanches. The central hypothesis that guides our work is that neuronal avalanches are the hallmark of a normal brain in a critical state. Critical states exist in complex systems at the balance of order and disorder and are governed by universal rules. In the cortex, these rules apply to the precise spatiotemporal interactions between neurons. Our hypothesis is based on an interdisciplinary approach that combines strong experimental evidence from my group, theories from physics, and clinical data obtained at the NIH Intramural Research Program. The rationale for the proposed research is that neuronal avalanches signify normal cortical function. Deviations from neuronal avalanches may serve as biomarkers to diagnose and monitor treatment of mental illnesses and neurological disorders. Our findings might pave the way for understanding higher cortical functions and have been replicated and extended by several national and international groups, thereby establishing our leading role in this field. Our research provides solutions for a wide variety of fundamental problems in neuroscience and offers promising directions in translational research.","1. We demonstrated for the first time that large expansive patterns of neuronal avalanches are linked to the selective activity of single nerve cells.  These findings settled a long-standing debate whether large avalanches represent highly specific incidences of neuronal activity. The demonstration of this finding in awake animals as well as in vitro systems pave the way for cellular analysis of avalanche dynamics under precisely controlled in vitro systems.Bellay et al. 20212. We demonstrated for the first time that the specific and unique brain architecture formed by neuronal avalanches is stable over many weeks and months.  The findings obtained with advanced multielectrode technology demonstrate avalanches to represent an overarching principle of brain activity despite ongoing developmental and other related plasticity changes. Miller et al., 20213. We demonstrated for the first time in extensive simulations of different neuronal models and collective systems how estimates of the delayed autocorrelation activity in single system elements can be used to homeostatically control neuronal avalanches in networks. Chialvo et al., 20204. We demonstrate how box-scaling can be used to overcome spatial limits in 2-photon imaging which prevent the identification of critical state dynamics in cortical activity. MartMartin et. al., 20205. We published a comprehensive review on the experimental evidence provided by numerous groups over the last 20 years on self-organized criticality in the brain.  This review demonstrates that the most robust signature of self-organized criticality in the form of neuron avalanches arises in so-called superficial cortical layers of the mammalian brain.  Accordingly, brain preparations that do not include superficial layers do not show robust signatures of criticality.  This review provides an important guide for future research with respect to potential experimental pitfalls in criticality research. Plenz et al., 20216. We provided a comprehensive review on how collective phenomena in the brain and in animal groups share common theoretical aspects such as the presence of so-called phase transition.

We study the causes and the consequences of anxiety. We try to understand when anxiety is beneficial and when it is detrimental to our daily activities. We develop experimental models of anxiety in humans to better understand the distinction between normal and pathological anxiety and to screen new treatments. Anxiety disorders are a major public health problem. At an estimated cost of more than $50 billion per year, anxiety disorders are extremely common. More than 40 million American adults and 10 million teenagers and children suffer from an anxiety disorder each year. However, these statistics do not consider the large number of people who struggle with anxiety but are not diagnosed with a disorder, or do not seek help. Current treatments are good, but they are not good enough. They have side-effects and do not work for everyone. Obstacles to the development of better treatments include the lack of objective signs of the disorders, poor clinical efficacy of candidate anti-anxiety drugs discovered through basic research in animals, and unsatisfactory classification due to imprecise boundaries between anxiety subtypes and to comorbidity. We believe that research on psychological and brain mechanisms will help reduce suffering from anxiety disorders. We build on our research on the psychological and neurobiological underpinnings of normal anxiety to identify malfunction in pathologic anxious states.

We believe that research on psychological and brain mechanisms will help reduce suffering from anxiety disorders. We build on our research on the psychological and neurobiological underpinnings of normal anxiety to identify malfunction in pathologic anxious states.Our research branches into 3 major projects. Project 1 examines the brain circuits mediating fear and anxiety. Project 2 focuses on the neurocognitive aspects of anxiety. Project 3 seeks to develop new treatments. We rely on several methods: 1) psychophysiology, with an approach strongly inspired from animal research (NCT00026559; NCT00055224), 2) neuroimaging, to elucidate the neural underpinnings of responses to threat (NCT00047853; NCT02423044), with a focus on the amygdala and on a neural circuit consisting of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, habenula, dorsal raphe nucleus, hippocampus, dorsomedial and ventromedial prefrontal cortex in the mediation and modulation of fear and anxiety. Functional brain imaging constitutes a first step toward brain-based diagnoses, endophenotypes and neurally-targeted interventions for the anxiety disorders by identifying brain correlates of these disorders (NCT03027414) and 3) treatments, to investigate mechanisms of drug anxiolytic action, develop paradigms that facilitate the drug discovery process, and explore new treatment modalities (e.g., mindfulness-based stress reduction) (NCT02153944).","The lab focuses on understanding several aspects of normal and pathological anxiety. Our research ranges from neuroimaging to understand brain mechanisms, psychophysiology to explore emotional reactivity, affective neuroscience to investigate cognitive processes, and psychopharmacology to screen new treatments.  To study attentional problems caused by anxiety, we have developed a research program that explores the interaction between anxiety and working memory (WM). WM refers to the temporary storage and manipulation of information (e.g., remembering a phone number when dialing the number). WM not only helps keep in mind our current goals, but it also gives rise to the conscious experience of anxiety . In past studies, we have identified brain structures of a fronto-parietal control network that play important roles in the interaction between anxiety and WM. More recently, we implemented a pharmacological manipulation using a cognitive enhancer, methylphenidate, to investigate the impact of improving cognition on anxiety. We showed that methylphenidate increases overall WM performance and strengthened the engagement of the fronto-parietal control network while also reducing the default mode network deactivation. The facilitation of neural activation can be interpreted as an expansion of cognitive resources, which could foster both the representation and integration of anxiety-provoking stimuli as well as the top-down regulatory processes to protect against the detrimental effect of anxiety. This mechanism might establish an optimal balance between the fronto-parietal control network (cognitive processing) and default mode network (emotion regulation) recruitment.Cognitive control, the mind's ability to actively create an information picture that guide behavior, is a key factor in the maintenance of mental health. However, cognitive control is an effortful process that can be weakened by mental fatigue. In a recent study, we examined whether mental fatigue could confer vulnerability to anxiety disorders, increasing the risk for these conditions. We investigated the effect of mental fatigue on attention bias for threat. Attention bias for threat is the tendency to disproportionately attend to negative stimuli (e.g., fearful face) over neutral or positive stimuli (e.g., smiling face). Research on anxiety has long pointed out that this information processing bias confers elevated risk for anxiety and the development and maintenance of anxiety disorders. Mental fatigue was induced in volunteer subjects by protracted performance on various cognitive tasks. Attentional bias was evaluated with the dot-probe, a test that tests subjects attention towards fearful and neutral faces.  Subjects reported increased subjective fatigue (feeling tired and less engaged in the task) following the mental fatigue induction procedure. Results showed that mental fatigue was associated with increased attentional bias for threat. Following mental fatigue, subjects paid more attention to fearful faces than to neutral faces. These results do not show that mental fatigue induces anxiety but shows that mental fatigue makes people more likely to attend to negative stimuli, which may facilitate the development of anxiety episodes and, potentially, anxiety disorders. This is an important finding with implications for mental health as mental fatigue is now a common phenomenon in everyday given that the nature of work has evolved from physical effort to mental effort. Epidemiology studies indicate that up to half the populations report feeling fatigue. In a recent survey, the 2-week period prevalence of fatigue in the US workforce was approximately 38%. In addition, numerous studies have shown an association between mental fatigue and anxiety. One of the labs objectives is to help discover new treatments. Psychiatric drug development is quite challenging, and many companies have abandoned the search for new therapies. Current treatment response rates for anxiety and trauma-based disorders rarely exceed 60% and no new agents for the treatment of these disorders have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or European authorities in the last decade. A considerable impediment to drug development is the long, arduous, and costly process through which a candidate drug moves from the discovery stage into an actual treatment. Currently, this process entails multiple steps, including screening candidate agents in animal models and moving to clinical trials in patients. A key problem to such approach is that most candidate anxiolytics with anti-anxiety effect in animal studies fail in clinical trials. We have argued that a new strategy is needed and, in a recent review, have proposed a new approach that may radically transform the pursuit of new anxiolytic treatments, via the use of human models of anxiety in healthy individuals. Specifically, we propose an additional screening step to help select candidate anxiolytics before launching clinical trials. This intermediate step moves the evidence for the potential anxiolytic property of candidate drugs from animals to humans, using experimental models of anxiety in healthy individuals. Anxiety-potentiated startle is a robust translational model of anxiety. The review of its face, construct, and predictive validity as well as its psychometric properties in humans establishes it as a promising tool for anxiolytic drug development. In conclusion, human models of anxiety may stir a faster, more efficient path for the development of clinically effective anxiolytics.Following this recommendation, we recently investigated in a human model a new compound that has shown anti-anxiety effects in animal model. Arginine vasopressin is a neuropeptide that modulates both physiological and emotional responses to threat. Until recently, drugs that target vasopressin receptors (V1a) in the human central nervous system were unavailable. The development of a novel V1a receptor antagonist, SRX246, enables the experimental validation of vasopressins role in the regulation of anxiety and fear in humans.  Our study examined the effects of SRX246 in a proof-of-concept translational paradigm of fear (phasic response to imminent threat) and anxiety (prolonged response to unpredictable threat). Threat consisted of unpleasant electric shocks. As expected, we found that SRX246 decreased anxiety induced by an unpredictable threat.  As anxiety to unpredictable threat is elevated in anxiety and trauma-associated disorders and decreased by traditional anxiolytics such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and benzodiazepines, the V1a receptor is a promising novel treatment target.In recent year, the lab has increased research in computational psychiatry. Analysis of resting state fMRI data has gained prominence as a tool to infer functional connectivity (fc) in brain networks. Functional connectivity is defined as the similarity in neural activity of anatomically distinct brain regions. Surprisingly, one underlying assumption of most fc analyses is temporal stationarity, i.e., no phase difference between the signals considered. However, there is increasing evidence that challenges this assumption. There are several methods that capture the dynamic nature of the fc. Our lab has implemented a new technique based on dynamic time warping (DTW). This technique was found to be more efficient in assessing the separability of the SNc-cortical and VTA-cortical network compared to traditional methods. Finally, we have initiated an online Covid study (NCT04377100). The study has 2 aims. The first examines how anxiety caused by COVID-19 affects motivation and mental health. The objective of the second study is to identify neural and clinical predictors (pre-COVID) of individual differences in the response to the pandemics.","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

We focus on developing genetically-encoded tools that can be used to functionally manipulate targeted neurons, and we use these tools to identify and characterize the functional components of neuronal networks. Our aim is to understand how such networks integrate information from the environment and the body to orchestrate ordered, goal-directed motor sequences. In broad terms, this means understanding how brains assign meaning to the signals they receive, and how they elaborate and prioritize purposeful responses to them. Because an animals priorities, purposes, and even the meanings it assigns to specific signals are potently modified by its behavioral state, we are also critically interested in understanding the determinants of such states. Such knowledge is germane to a basic understanding of human mental disorders. Some, such as depressive and anxiety disorders, include dysregulation of behavioral state as a major feature, while others, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, involve deficits in initiating, terminating, or organizing behavior.Consistent with our aims, our research has focused on the neural circuitry underlying a developmentally recurring behavioral state in the fruit fly that occurs in conjunction with molting. Molting requires the execution of a stage-specific motor sequence (called an ecdysis sequence) that is typically used to first loosen, and then shed, the exoskeleton of the previous developmental stage. In many insects, an ecdysis sequence may also include a motor program to promote expansion and hardening of the new exoskeleton. Such a program is included in the ecdysis sequence of Drosophila at the adult molt, where it also serves to expand and harden the newly formed wings. Ecdysis sequences are induced by a hormone called Ecdysis Triggering Hormone (ETH), which acts to prioritize the execution of an ecdysis sequence over other behaviors. At the time of the pupal molt, this prioritization is absolute and the animal performs an ecdysis sequence to the exclusion of any other behavior. At the adult molt, the animal initiates an ecdysis sequence, but can choose to delay its progression depending on environmental conditions. By studying the neural basis of the adult ecdysis sequence, my laboratory seeks to elucidate the brain mechanisms underlying behavioral decisions, whereas by studying the neural basis of the pupal ecdysis sequence our goal is to understand how hormonal signals govern behavioral state transitions and are converted into the temporally ordered motor output of the pupal ecdysis sequence.In general, our work on the ecdysis network seeks to answer basic questions about how motor sequences are initiated, sustained, and terminated and how their component programs are assembled and temporally organized by the nervous system to assure the achievement of adaptive goals. Throughout, we wish to determine what role hormones and neuromodulators play in these processes and how they prioritize the execution of certain behaviors over others. This work has as its fundamental aim the derivation of principles of neural circuit function. We seek to understand both the specific mechanisms by which nervous systems accomplish particular tasks and the general mechanisms by which they coordinate the execution of all tasks they face. By elucidating the functional neuroarchitectures that support the task of ecdysis, work in our laboratory thus aims to deliver insights into the general operation of all nervous systems.","Insect ecdysis sequences represent a simple, robust, and tractable model for studying the neuromodulatory mechanisms that govern behavior. Because initiation of an ecdysis sequence involves a profound shift in behavioral priorities, study of these sequences offers the opportunity to understand the neuromodulatory mechanisms that govern changes in behavioral state. In addition, because ecdysis behaviors are inherently sequential, they permit the systematic investigation of how motor programs are assembled and serially executed by the nervous system. Finally, the study of ecdysis sequences promises insight into how neural circuits can be variably configured to generate immensely different behaviors. In Drosophila, for example, the motor sequences performed at pupal and adult ecdysis are completely different. This is because of the profound differences in the pupal and adult body plans. Despite these anatomical differences, the two behavioral sequences are governed by a common set of neuromodulatory/hormonal inputs. By analogy to computing, these inputs can be regarded as instructions written in a higher programming language that are then compiled into different outputs. Exposing the mechanisms of neural compilation in ecdysis is likely to deeply inform our understanding of how neuromodulators contribute to neurocomputation by reconfiguring the activity of neural networks.To investigate these issues, my laboratory seeks to elucidate the circuitry that governs both the pupal and adult ecdysis sequences in Drosophila. Our efforts over the last year have been more or less evenly divided between study of these two circuits. With regard to pupal ecdysis, the work conducted over the past year has focused on describing the pupal ecdysis sequence at the highest possible level of resolution, namely the activity of each of the individual muscles of the animal. This work was motivated by the realization that if we are to understand in detail how the fly brain generates a pupal ecdysis sequence, we must first understand in detail what, exactly, it is generating. While comprehensively monitoring single muscle activity in behaving animals is generally impossible, we leveraged several advantages of the Drosophila pupal preparation to do so. Muscles in the pupa, for example, are relatively well-separated and ordered, enabling their identification during activity. More importantly, the pupal ecdysis sequence is performed within the confines of the so-called puparium, the protective casing in which the animal undergoes metamorphosis. The puparium can be clarified to permit imaging during behavior, and the animal remains in the field of view during execution of the entire sequence. Muscle activity can thus be comprehensively recorded using genetically encoded calcium indicators. By imaging animals from the dorsal, lateral, and ventral aspects we were able to fully document muscle activity underlying the pupal ecdysis sequence in scores of animals.Among our several discoveries was a previously undescribed phase of pupal muscle activity preceding the onset of ecdysis behavior. Activity during this novel phase consists of stochastic combinations of muscle contractions that result in small twitches rather than coherent movement. This phase of activity, which we call P0, is driven by nervous system activity and becomes coherent only with the release of ETH, which initiates the pupal ecdysis sequence. We showed that suppression of a subset of neurons that respond to ETHnamely those that express the B-isoform of the ETH receptorimpairs the initiation of pupal ecdysis by preventing coordinated activity of specific muscle groups. In fact, our analysis showed that these and other groups of muscles that exhibited coincident activity were common throughout the ecdysis sequence. We identified eight such groups and found that they are assembled in various temporal combinations to compose most pupal ecdysis movements. These movements could also be categorized into eight elementary classes, which are sufficiently stereotyped to be recognized from their patterns of single muscle calcium activity by a trained convolutional neural network (CNN). Together, the eight movements account for all organized pupal ecdysis behavior. Although pupal ecdysis behavior exhibits stereotypy at higher levels of behavioral description, we also found considerable evidence of stochasticity. This was evident in the frequent idiosyncratic muscle contractions observed during the pupal ecdysis sequence. In addition, the order of recruitment of muscle activity into co-active groups, or of these groups into movements, was highly variable. A major observation was that release of ecdysis hormones reduces variability of muscle activity and increases behavioral coherence, as illustrated by the example of ETH terminating P0 and initiating ecdysis. Because muscle calcium activity directly reflects the output of the motor system, our results provide a template onto which nervous system activity can be mapped to better understand how behavior is generated. Our results have recently been published in the journal eLife (eLife 2021;10:e68656).Our study of the adult ecdysis circuit over the past year has focused primarily on understanding the dual roles of the hormone Bursicon in wing expansion. Our previous work had shown that Bursicon released from a single pair of neurons (called the BSEG) was important in helping flies decide whether to expand their wings after adult ecdysis depending on environmental conditions. Expanding under adverse conditions risks permanently damaging the wings and flies will generally delay wing expansion and seek better conditions rather than risk damage. Using the Trojan exon technology that we developed in 2015 (Diao et al., 2015, Cell Rep. 10:1410-21) to investigate targets of Bursicon, we have now found that a key component of the decision-making circuitry is a set of cholinergic neurons that express the Bursicon receptor. These neurons signal back to the BSEG via a positive feedback loop to initiate and maintain wing expansion in an environmentally sensitive manner. Importantly, glutamatergic motor neurons that express the Bursicon receptor are also critical for producing the behaviors required for wing expansion. The hormone Bursicon thus targets neurons at two different circuit levels to motivate and execute wing expansion behavior. At the higher level, a positive feedback loop promotes robust secretion of Bursicon to provide drive, and at the lower level this drive (represented by high levels of Bursicon release) directly promotes motor execution. This work has recently been submitted for publication.In technology development, my laboratory has continued to refine methods that exploit the use of split inteins. We are actively adapting our SpaRCLIn technique, which is based on the use of a split Cre recombinase and which was published in 2020 in eLife (eLIFE: Apr 14;9:e53041), for use with the Split Gal4 method. The latter method was introduced by my laboratory in 2006 (Neuron 52:425-436) and has since become a workhorse for circuit-mapping efforts in Drosophila. Last year, we published a comprehensive review of the Split Gal4 technology and its various applications (Front Neural Circuit 14:603397). In summary, we have made good progress during the last year in advancing research on the principal questions of interest to the laboratory. At the same time, we have continued to develop technology that supports not only our own circuit mapping efforts, but also those of other members of the Drosophila research community. As we use these tools to extend and refine our analysis of the circuitry underlying ecdysis sequences, our work should provide insight into the principles that govern the development and function of behavioral circuits in all organisms, including humans.","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the cerebral cortex. GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter. Together, they account for approximately 90% of total cortical synapses. Both glutamate and GABA can be detected noninvasively using a unique technique called in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). This technique can noninvasively measure glutamate and GABA, and also many other chemicals (such as N-acetylaspartyl glutamate, glutathione, phosphocreatine, creatine, choline, myoinositol, and lactate) in the living brain. Our overall goals are to develop novel MRS and MRI strategies to characterize brain neurochemical profiles and dynamics, with a focus on glutamate and GABA, and to apply these techniques to studying glutamatergic and GABAergic function (protocols NCT01266577 and NCT00109174). These efforts have enabled us to address fundamental questions of glutamatergic and GABAergic functions in brain, their interactions, and mechanisms of glutamatergic and GABAergic drugs. By infusing carbon-13 labeled substrates, in particular, we can use dynamic MRS techniques to study the metabolism and neurotransmission of glutamate and GABA. Our carbon-13 magnetic resonance spectroscopy techniques have also allowed us to noninvasively measure specific brain enzymes, and we have also developed chemical relaxation methods for probing cell-type-specific microenvironments in brain.","The goal of this research is to develop advanced magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and imaging  techniques and to apply them and other complementary methods to study brain metabolism, neurotransmission, and enzyme activity. MRS allows in vivo measurement of the neurotransmission of glutamate and GABA, which plays important roles in many major psychiatric diseases, including depression and schizophrenia.During 2020 we completed quantification of 13C labeling of both glutamate and glutamine measured from a 12.6 cm3 voxel placed in the limbic structure of human brain at 7 Tesla. This was achieved using a new technique developed by our group that uses proton channel only. For 13C labeling of the much weaker glutamine signal we obtained an intra-subject coefficient of variation of 11% for the 13C fractional enrichment of glutamine C4. Our results demonstrated that both glutamate and glutamine 13C labeling can be measured with very high precision from a small localized region with the sensitivity of proton MRS using standard hardware for studying glutamate neurotransmission in vivo. Furthermore, we have finished our analysis of 13C MRS data acquired from the frontal lobe of human subjects. Our results demonstrated that carbonic anhydrase activity can be quantified from the frontal lobe of human brain using saturation transfer 13C MRS (Li et al, Carbonic anhydrase activity in the frontal lobe of human brain, NMR Biomed., 34:e4501 (2021). By comparing with the bicarbonate dehydrate rate constant measured from the occipital lobe, we found no significant difference in carbonic anhydrase activity between frontal and occipital lobes in heathy subjects. This observation makes it possible to use carbonic anhydrase activity in the occipital lobe as an internal control in psychiatric studies. By performing line fitting of 13C signals using a linear combination model, we further found that glutamine C5 and aspartate C4 can be fitted well, despite the much larger static magnetic field distortion in the frontal lobe. Our Cramer-Rao lower bound for glutamine C5/glutamate C5 ratio is 10.6%, similar to those observed in many proton MRS studies. Therefore, both glutamate C5, which is not overlapped by other signals, and glutamine C5, which is overlapped by aspartate C4, can be measured in the carboxylic/amide region of 13C MRS from the frontal lobe at 7 Tesla using oral administration of uniformly 13C-labeled glucose. In addition to the above, we are also making progress in  developing novel techniques to increase the sensitivity of 13C-labeled signals.Membrane lipids are implicated in many neuropsychiatric disorders including major depression. Although phosphoesters can be measured by 31P MRS their quantification has been highly controversial. We acquired 31P MRS data from human subjects at both 3 and 7 Tesla. We found a large discrepancy between phosphoesters measured at 3 and 7 Tesla using standard spectral fitting techniques. Our observation matches literature reports. However, there has been no analysis of this discrepancy, hindering application of 31P MRS to characterizing membrane metabolism in neuropsychiatric disorders. We discovered that the phosphocreatine/(phosphocholine + glycerophosphocholine) ratio is approximately a constant (2.5) due to intrinsic biochemical constraints. Using this internal standard we established that phosphoesters can be accurately measured at 7 Tesla using 31P MRS, while at 3 Tesla 31P MRS with standard fitting procedures significantly underestimates phosphoesters (Li et al, Cerebral phosphoester signals measured by 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 3 and 7 Tesla, PLoS One, 16:e0248632 (2021)).","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

This study focuses on the specificity of familial transmission of disorders in the mood disorder spectrum (i.e. symptoms, symptom clusters, subtypes) and the role of comorbidity with anxiety disorders and physical disorders (including migraine and cardiovascular diseases) in defining subtypes of mood disorders.  The overall goal of this work is to identify the core clinical and biologic factors underlying mood disorder spectrum and migraine that are familial. The major contributions of this research include: 1) identification of clinical phenotypes that breed true in families and are specific to particular subtypes of mood disorders; 2) refinement of phenotypes for the diagnostic nomenclature; 3) resolution of the role of comorbid disorders, particularly sleep disorders, anxiety and migraine, as indicators of subtypes of these disorders; and 4) elucidation of age and development-specific patterns of expression of salient components of the mood disorder spectrum across the lifespan. The project was implemented in several phases including: 1) development of measures of the spectrum of mood and anxiety disorders in adults and children, and structured interviews for the key components of the study phenotypes including mood, sleep and headache; 2) sampling and recruitment of probands from both clinical and community settings and enrollment and evaluation of the relatives; 3) selection and implementation of measures of core features and endophenotypes for mood disorders and migraine; and 4) establishment of a high risk cohort to study the evolution of these disorders and the specificity of vulnerability markers and endophenotypes prior to clinical onset of these conditions.In order to identify the core features of mood and anxiety disorders and their overlap with sleep problems, cardiovascular diseases and migraine, we have established a comprehensive set of clinical, psychophysiological and neuropsychological measures. The measures are divided into three components: 1) clinical information that includes a semi-structured diagnostic interview for mood and anxiety disorders; structured diagnostic interviews for major headache syndromes and sleep disorders; family history information on psychiatric disorders, sleep disorders and headache syndromes; a series of self-reported measures of symptoms, sleep patterns and personality; medical history, family structure, history and function, and major life/family events; 2) in person evaluation at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center that includes physical and neurological examination; autonomic nervous system evaluation using tilt and valsalva maneuver; laboratory measures of metabolic, cardiovascular, and immunologic function; psychophysiologic evaluation including startle reflex and eyeblink reflex; structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); a computerized cognitive assessment battery; and olfactory function testing; and 3) two-week assessment of daily activities including an electronic diary that assesses daily rhythms including mood, anxiety, sleep, stress, activity, diet, and social activities; heart rate reactivity using a holter monitor; activity and sleep using an actiwatch; and salivary hormones collected four times per day.The major aims have been largely accomplished through the establishment of a large community-based family study of adult probands who participated in comprehensive clinical and biologic assessments followed by comparable evaluations of their adult and child relatives. Recruitment is near completion and a second wave of follow-up and data management/analyses are ongoing.","To date, over 600 probands and nearly 1200 of their relatives have completed the study, including 200 children between the ages of 7-17 years. Approximately 600 individuals have also been evaluated at the NIH Clinical Center. Probands represent not only a large range of psychiatric disorders including mood and anxiety spectrum but also substantial medical comorbidity related to sleep, migraine, pain, and cardiovascular conditions, as well as controls with minimal to no pathology. We are focusing on  remotely collecting measures including mobile assessments and saliva for extracting genetics data, and recontacting relatives for updated information.During the past year, we have shifted our emphasis to to validating and streamlining research operations. We have devoted research effort to collect follow-up data from families to maximize our ability to study causes, correlates, and consequences of these interrelated conditions. This involved repeating diagnostic interviews and self-report clinical and psychosocial measures, in order to test the stability of these measures over time and track their relationship with emerging mental and medical disorders in probands and family members. To streamline data entry, management, and analyses, we have shifted to administering many of the assessments electronically to permit remote data collection.  We are continuing to work with experts to develop efficient platforms to visualize multilevel data in R and to develop a platform that combines data acquisition with data management and analysis. We are also developing computer programs to exploit the item-level data from diagnostic interviews and related measures, including algorithms for subthreshold syndromes, clinical phenomena, and self-report measures. We are also completing collection of DNA samples for both probands and relatives and conducted preliminary analyses of the first phase of the study.We have devoted substantial effort to the refinement and publication of prior preliminary findings, in addition to pursuing promising new work. During the past year, our work focused on: 1) analyses of the familial aggregation and coaggregation of core clinical phenotypes in the family study including mood and anxiety disorder subtypes with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and substance use disorders, as well as sleep disorders, pain-related conditions, migraine, and other chronic medical conditions; 2) investigation of the associations between mood and anxiety disorder subtypes and familial transmission of the core domains underlying mood and anxiety disorders including sleep patterns and chronotype, cardiovascular risk factors, hyperthymia and anxiety-related temperaments, and startle and autonomic reactivity; 3) data harmonization and confirmation of findings from our family study with those of a parallel family study in Lausanne, Switzerland, as well as synthesizing high-risk family environment linked to bipolar disorder (BD); and 4) beginning to exploit larger datasets available from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium to create polygenic risk scores for our own data. Recent publications from our research team have focused on familial aggregation of mood and anxiety disorders in probands and first-degree relatives from our family study sample. With collaborators from Australia, we examined the familial aggregation/coaggregation of anxiety disorder subtypes and anxiety-related temperamental traits, and their association with mood disorders. Our findings suggested that anxiety-related temperamental traits may indicate a vulnerability for mood and anxiety disorders or a potential consequence of these conditions (Iorfino et al, 2020). We also studied the familial aggregation of ADHD and its cross-transmission with BD. Results indicated specificity of familial aggregation of both bipolar I disorder (BP1) and bipolar II disorder (BP2), and no evidence for ADHD and BD cross-transmission in first-degree relatives. Future research is warranted to reconcile the discrepant findings with respect to the common versus independent familial diatheses underlying BD and ADHD (Walsh et al, 2020). Continuing our work to examine mood disorder subtypes from childhood to adulthood, in collaboration with researchers in our parallel family study in Lausanne, we aimed to identify differences in patterns of psychopatholgical precursors among youth with (hypo)mania compared to major depressive disorder (MDD), and whether these patterns differ by subtypes of parental mood disorders. Our findings point to distinct pathways to the development of BD and unipolar mood disorders, and that these precursors differed by mood subtype in offspring. High-risk offspring with these precursors should be closely monitored to prevent further development of MDD or conversion to BD (Rudaz et al, 2020). We continue to devote major effort toward methods development and dissemination and analyses of dynamic phenotypes derived from actigraphy and electronic diaries, which permit investigation of fluctuations in core domains of mood disorders in the context of daily life. This work has been conducted in conjunction with collaborators across multiple sites including Lausanne, Switzerland; Sydney, Australia; Amsterdam, Netherlands; and Hong Kong, China. We continue to conduct methodological work, with collaborators at Johns Hopkins University, focused on educating our peer researchers about the knowledge that can be gained by conducting analyses that respect time of day rather than averaging across days and weeks. Such methodological collaborations highlight opportunities for discovery in psychiatric research afforded by mobile technologies. We previously studied mood dynamics and reactivity and differential patterns of reactivity for those with BP1 compared to those with BP2, MDD, and anxiety disorders, providing phenomenological support for distinguishing BP1 from other affective disorders. In contrast, groups did not differ in their degree of mood variability or instability compared to controls. These findings contribute to our understanding of the underlying bases of mood and anxiety disorders, consistent with the overall objectives of our research program. Finally, expanding upon these findings as well as our prior findings on the role of activity in mood regulation, we have established a workgroup which will conduct follow-up analyses to examine the influence of other factors such as substance use/disorders, exercise, and eating in these relationships.   Public Health Impact:Integration of the clinical, neuropsychological, and psychophysiological measures within families will render an in-depth analysis of the mechanisms crucial to mood and anxiety disorders and their underlying diatheses. This will not only lead to a better fundamental, etiologic understanding of these conditions, but also may inform the development of novel treatment options, possible strategies for early intervention, and potential prevention in those with elevated risk for these conditions. Future Plans:During the next year, we plan to shift our efforts from data collection to data analysis in order to exploit the rich and comprehensive clinical, biologic and genetic data from the study. Substantively, our focus will remain centered on the causes, correlates, and consequences of mood spectrum disorders, guided by our growing body of findings related to energy, motor activity, and other biorhythms linked to homeostasis; mental-medical comorbidity and the mechanistic association thereof; and psychiatric endophenotypes and risk processes associated with BD ranging from anxiety disorders to substance use disorders to suicide. These analyses will further discern subgroups in whom more intensive follow-up will examine key clinical and biological questions addressed by this protocol.",There were no publications during this reporting period,"[('Elizabeth Day Ballard, PhD Experimental Therapeutics and Pathophysiology Branch', 'Experimental Therapeutics and Pathophysiology Branch'), ('Christian  Grillon, PhD Section on Neurobiology of Fear and Anxiety', 'Section on Neurobiology of Fear and Anxiety'), ('Francis Joseph McMahon, MD Section on the Genetic Basis of Mood and Anxiety Disorders', 'Section on the Genetic Basis of Mood and Anxiety Disorders'), ('Carlos Alberto Zarate, MD Section on Neurobiology and Treatment of Mood Disorders', 'Section on Neurobiology and Treatment of Mood Disorders')]",,

BD typically starts early in life, impairing social and occupational functioning over many years. BD is also a leading risk factor for suicide, a major cause of death in several age groups.Despite this large public health burden, relatively little is known about the causes or treatment of BD, aside from the strong contribution of genetic factors. In recent years, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many genes that appear to contribute to risk for BD, but little is known about how these genes act upon brain biology.The goal of this project is to understand how particular genes and genetic variants act biologically to influence risk for BD and related conditions. We study both post-mortem and living tissues. Gene expression signatures in brain tissue donated by people who died with BD  can reveal gene networks and pathways that are dysregulated in BD. We also employ revolutionary cellular re-programming methods that produce induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) which can be differentiated into brain cells (neurons and glia) that genetically match the donor, providing a cellular model system for observing the functional impact of risk variants and testing new treatments. Since cells and tissues cannot easily model circuit-level dysfunctions, we also use neuroimaging data to assess the structural and functional impact of genes of interest in living human volunteers. Enrollees in our ongoing Bipolar Genetics study (ZIA-MH002843) are referred for diffusion tensor imaging thru the Human Connectome Project. Ongoing work seeks to uncover genetic correlations between heritable connectome traits and risk for BD and other psychiatric disorders. In addition to genes implicated by GWAS, sequencing, or other studies, we also study rare structural variations in DNA, known as copy number variants (CNVs), that may strongly influence risk for BD in particular families.","NCT00001174Despite strong evidence of heritability and growing discovery of genetic markers for major mental illness, little is known about how gene expression in the brain differs across psychiatric diagnoses, or how inherited genetic risk factors shape these differences. We have studied expression of genes and gene transcripts in postmortem subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC), a key component of limbic circuits linked to mental illness. Deep sequencing was carried out in RNA obtained postmortem from 200 donors diagnosed with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, major depression, or no psychiatric disorder. Case-control comparisons detected modest expression differences that were similar across disorders, although transcript-level differences were more pronounced. The 250 rare transcripts that were differentially expressed were enriched for genes involved in synapse formation, cell junctions, and heterotrimeric G-protein complexes. Relative abundances of alternatively spliced transcripts were associated with common genetic variants that accounted for disproportionate fractions of diagnosis-specific heritability. Inherited genetic risk factors shape the brain transcriptome and contribute to diagnostic differences between broad classes of mental illness. We also seek to model the impact of disease-related genes in cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines. This project aims to explore ways in which we can use iPSC technology to study the biological impact of genes and genetic mutations that we identify in our other ongoing studies. Working with the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) stem cell core we have so far successfully reprogrammed fibroblasts into iPSCs from over 72 study participants. We are developing a large iPSC-based resource and associated work-flows that constitute a living catalog of psychiatric risk alleles.iPSC-derived cells are studied with high-resolution microscopic imaging, electrophysiology, and gene expression methods. These data could reveal differences between control and patient-derived cells and the impact of known and novel therapeutic agents. In collaboration with scientists at the New York Stem Cell Foundation Research Institute, we are also exploring ways to measure the functional impact of genetic mutations at the cellular level and to use genome editing tools such as CRISPR-Cas9 to rescue cellular phenotypes and establish a causal role for specific genetic mutations.A previous proof-of-concept study demonstrated the value of iPSC-based assays for translating even common, low-risk alleles identified by GWAS into novel genetic, neurobiological, and pharmacological insights. Currently we are working on methods to map regulatory chromatin contacts in neural progenitor cells. This will enable the identification of developmental stage and treatment specific influences on chromatin structure and gene expression.  Our ongoing CNV studies examine the impact of known pathogenic CNVs at the level of iPSC-derived neural cells and in post-mortem brain. In the past year, we carried out extensive morphological and transcriptomic characterization of neural cells carrying a duplication CNV on chromosome 16p11.2 which has previously been associated with BD and other psychiatric disorders. Transcriptomic analyses indicate that some genes in the duplicated region show increased expression in neurons, but that many other genes are also dysregulated in CNV carriers. Overexpressed genes are enriched for several pathways, including neuronal growth and proliferation, MAP kinase signaling, and cell migration. Comparisons between carriers and sex-matched non-carriers revealed major differences in cellular differentiation and growth. Carrier neurons also showed fewer post-synaptic structures. While non-carrier NPCs easily differentiated into astrocytes using standard protocols, carrier NPCs did not differentiate into mature astrocytes. Astrocytes are known to play a critical role in the development and maintenance of healthy neurons and synapses. We have found that exogenous astrocytes from mouse  rescue most of the neurodevelopmental and synaptic deficits in 16p11.2 duplication carriers. These results demonstrate that developmental deficits in astrocytes among carriers play a causal role in the syndrome. We are now screening a variety of medications to identify drugs that can help compensate for reduced astrocyte function. Multigenic disorders such as BD pose special challenges for experimental studies, since a single causative mutation is usually not identifiable. Thus we are also studying rare, single-gene disorders whose symptoms overlap with those seen in common mental illnesses. Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by behavioral abnormalities and disruptions in circadian rhythm. Cells from people living with SMS obtained in collaboration with Ann Smith (NHGRI) have been reprogrammed into iPSCs and differentiated into neurons and other brain cells. We are using these cells to explore gene-expression, molecular, and morphological traits associated with SMS mutations in cultured brain cells.  Causal connections with candidate cellular phenotypes will be established using gene editing techniques such as CRISPR. The results suggest that SMS mutations cause increases in proliferation and neurite outgrowth especially among excitatory neurons, consistent with proposed excitation/inhibition imbalance models of pathogenesis. Findings from this study may have relevance to other neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression, autism, and BD.In the coming year, we will continue studies in neural cells derived from people with BD, carriers of pathogenic CNVs, and rare damaging mutations within GWAS or CNV loci that run together with BD and related conditions in families. If successful, these projects will help unpack the biology behind GWAS results, identify high-risk alleles, and shed new light on how risk alleles act within neural cells to generate biological changes in the brain. The findings may also identify new targets that lead to better methods of diagnosis and treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders.","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

Our impression of the world is, in a sense, internally generated but externally grounded. Despite decades of research, the complexity of brain function is such that scientists struggle to understand the neural underpinnings of even the simplest percepts. Humans and other primates are inherently visual beings, with highly developed visual systems that exploit the fact that vision allows for a detailed scrutiny of the environment quietly, and from a safe distance. Thus much of our interaction with the external world and with each other depends on vision the reliability of our vision. , How the human brain is able to create and support our conscious percepts, and to embellish them with specialized and workable knowledge about objects, actions, and meaning, is one of the great mysteries of neuroscience.To understand our visual capabilities, it is important to consider the primate retina, and particularly its foveal zone of ultra-high-detail vision. It is this feature that affords us unusually high capacity to see detail at a distance, certainly compared to other mammals. More than other species, who are specialized more for olfactory and acoustic cues, humans and other primates depend on vision for social interactions, and also for the integration of vision with complex manual actions, such as reaching and grasping, reading, or, in the case of humans, playing a musical instrument. Our visual world has strongly shaped the evolution of human cognition, and this aspect can go awry in a number of psychiatric disorders. For example, we often need to decide, based on a quick visual assessment, whether a given person is trustworthy or whether a situation is safe. These quick judgements during fluid, natural experience, are among the most important and finely tuned features of human vision.Visual perception has always been, and remains, a central feature of our research program, as it is important for understanding key aspects of human behavior for at least two reasons. First, the faculty of vision is the key model of human sensation in general, since vision is the primary sense that humans use to interact with their environment, particularly from a distance. Second, these interpretive elements of the senses can go awry in psychiatric and neurological disorders. Our current understanding of vision rests on a shared understanding of a canonical cortical microcircuit, the visual hierarchy, dorsal and ventral pathways, and various neural representations. While these concepts have greatly advanced our understanding of the brain, they are the product of a rather narrow set of paradigms, thus it is important to continue to push in new directions if we are to understand the operational principles of human vision.We are currently focusing on the neural basis of three interrelated aspects of visual perception. First, we are working to understand the principles by which the brain encodes everyday visual stimuli, such as the decipherment of faces, actions, and other facets of our social world. Second, we are studying the responses in the visual cortex to complex and dynamic natural scenes. Third, we are studying the pathways for visual processing that delineate which of the many aspects of the visual input find their way into our conscious visual awareness.","Vision holds reign over many aspects of human cognition, allowing us to make detailed observations of the world, its objects, spatial layout, and one another. Visual cognition infuses our thought processes, our memory, and our language.  This human exceptionalism rests atop an impressive visual repertoire shared by many other mammalian species, who use vision for important aspects of their natural life.  Our research investigates the neural mechanisms involved in basic perception, including that of  objects, scenes, and individuals. Much of what we understand about this process comes from experiments in which isolated stimuli are presented onto a screen.  This simplified stimulation method allows for the evaluation of responses across the brain.  Over several decades, this approach has led researchers to conceive of vision as series of processing stages in the brain, whereby the stimulation of more and more specialized neurons lead to the subjective elements of our visual experience.  While this has been our view as well, our recent foray into more naturalistic visual approaches, summarized in our recent review (Leopold and Park, 2020), has led us into new experimental domains. In one project, we have investigated whether there is a fundamental difference between continual visual experience, as for example experienced while watching a video, and the discrete stimulation of the brain that forms the basis of most visual neuroscience experiments.  In our experiments, we have allowed subjects to freely view natural movies that play out over several minutes, record their gaze and brain activity during this time. In one study, which is now nearing submission, we determined that the continuity of vision itself strongly influenced the responses of the brain.  For example, when the response selectivity of neurons to elements of a video was compared to the randomized presentation of those elements in isolation, many neurons showed minimal correspondence.  This was particularly true for the onset response of the brief presentations, which had a near-zero correlation with the same neurons responses observed during continuous viewing.In another project, we are examining widespread components of the fMRI signal that are entrained by video viewing.  This signal, elicited consistently by repeated viewings of the same videos, is expressed simultaneously across most visually responsive regions of the brain.  This signal is not one that would be predicted by standard models of visual processing. Moreover, we have shown that it is synchronized with the activity of certain high-level visual neurons.  This work is closely related to our other studies using the method of single-unit fMRI mapping, as well as to those studying the particular role of the basal forebrain in regulating network activity across the brain. In a third project, from which a manuscript is currently in preparation, we have begun to investigate the way that the high-level visual areas within the brain encode spatial structure. Until now, the theories of object vision have taken the brain's representation of objects to be nearly independent of space and put aside attributions such as whether the brain is tuned for the absolute size of an object or its distance from an observer. Our initial results suggest that these variables are strongly represented in the responses of object-selective neurons in the brain. Interestingly, however, our results suggest that neurons are not tuned for the expected absolute size of objects, but rather for extreme absolute sizes.  This surprising finding is currently under further investigation in the laboratory, including its possibly relationships to the brains embedding of norms for perception.","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

Worldwide, mood disorders are one of the largest sources of death and disability. Bipolar disorder typically starts early in life, impairing social and occupational functioning over many years. Mood disorders are also the leading risk factor for suicide, a major cause of death in several age groups. Relatively little is known about the causes of mood disorders, aside from the strong contribution of genetic factors. The long-term objective of this study is to identify genes that influence risk, clinical presentation, and treatment response in major mood disorders. We anticipate that these genes will help illuminate the pathophysiology and may point the way to better methods of prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.","NCT00001174Starting in 1993, in collaboration with 10 academic centers across the US, we recruited a large sample of over 3,000 individuals with bipolar or other mood disorders. All participants did a diagnostic interview and provided a blood sample for DNA analysis. DNA and clinical data are available through the NIMH Center for Genetics. Genetic linkage studies suggested several chromosomal regions may contain genes that contribute to mood disorders in this sample. To identify individual causal genes, we conducted the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of bipolar disorder (BD) in 2007. The results implicated several genes, each of small effect, suggesting that BD is a polygenic disease. A second, larger study published in 2010 implicated a cluster of genes on chromosome 3p21 and suggested genetic overlap with major depression. An even larger study published in 2013 that included patients of Asian ancestry supported many of the previous findings and found 3 additional genetic markers of BD. Most of these findings have now been replicated in independent samples. To identify additional risk loci, in 2018 we performed a meta-analysis of >9 million genetic variants in over 40,000 individuals. In the past year, the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium Bipolar Disorder Workgroup, in which we are active collaborators, completed an additional GWAS with over 50,000 cases, the largest to date. The results identified 64 genome-wide significant loci, over half of which are novel. Taken together, the common risk variants account for almost one-third of the inherited risk of bipolar disorder. Implicated genes are enriched for targets of antipsychotics, calcium channel blockers, antiepileptics, and other novel drugs.  These large GWAS also provide a valuable set of reference data for calculating polygenic risk scores (PRS) that capture the combined influence of many alleles of small effect. We are exploring ways in which the PRS can be used to better understand individual differences in the onset, course, and presentation of BD. In the past year, we completed a study of PRS to address the high rates of comorbid anxiety in bipolar disorder, a largely unexplained phenomenon. Does this comorbidity reflect shared genetic risk? Results showed that among individuals with BD, genetic risk for anxiety is associated with comorbid anxiety disorders and recurrent suicide attempts in BD. Surprisingly, genetic risk for bipolar disorder itself was not related to any of these variables. In other samples, anxiety showed more genetic overlap with depression and neuroticism than with bipolar disorder itself. These findings suggest that comorbid anxiety in BD reflects partly non-overlapping contributions of bipolar and anxiety-related genes. Treatments that address this dual genetic burden may improve outcomes in people with this common comorbidity.To identify rarer genetic variants that may have a larger impact on risk for major mood disorders, we have undertaken genome sequencing studies in families and special populations. So far, we have collected more than 1000 individuals from Amish and Mennonite communities whose unique genetic history makes them especially good candidates for this kind of study. All blood samples are processed by the Rutgers Cell and DNA Repository which distributes DNA as a resource for the general scientific community. In addition to standard psychiatric diagnostic assessments, participants are asked to complete measures of memory, concentration, and other cognitive domains, along with dimensional measures of mood and anxiety. These data will allow us to better characterize the range of phenotypes present in carriers of risk alleles, many of whom are not expected to have diagnosable mental illness. Through a collaboration with investigators at the Univ Maryland, we will also investigate brain connectivity in selected cases, using multi-modal neuroimaging. Skin biopsies are obtained on sequenced individuals and converted to fibroblasts. Several fibroblast lines have been reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells for functional genomic studies (see ZIA-MH002810). In collaboration with investigators at Regeneron, Inc., we have now performed exome sequencing on over 1000 participants. Preliminary analyses have identified hundreds of otherwise rare genetic variants that occur much more frequently in participants with a history of BD or a related mental illness. With this data set, we are able to look for recurrent rare mutations, as well as mutations that have accumulated within individual genes and gene-sets. The current sample size is well powered to detect variants that confer substantial risk for BD. If such variants are not detected, larger samples will be needed to detect variants that confer more modest risk of illness. The exome data have been submitted to the Bipolar Sequencing Consortium, where they will become part of a large meta-analysis that brings together samples from many groups around the world in order to improve statistical power to detect variants of modest effect. We have also found several large copy number variants (CNVs) that have been previously implicated in psychiatric disorders. Tissue samples from carriers of these CNVs have been reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells for use in ongoing and planned functional genomics studies (see ZIA MH002810). This year, in collaboration with Morgan Similuk and colleagues at the NIAID Genetic Counseling Group, we have reached out to participants diagnosed with a psychiatric illness who carry certain CNVs whose role in psychiatric illness is well established to offer them the opportunity to be informed of our genetic findings and undergo formal genetic counseling. In the course of these interactions we will measure mood, anxiety, perceived stigma, and understanding of the genetic information we present. This will provide valuable data concerning the impact of genetic diagnosis on psychiatric patients who carry pathogenic CNVs.     In the past year, we also reached out to recent study participants to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their mental health. Surveys of stress, anxiety, mood, and general well-being were sent to hundreds of past participants. Data from the first wave of respondents is currently being prepared for analysis.In the coming year, we will enroll additional participants, perform additional exome sequencing, expand exome-wide genetic association analyses in larger sets of sequenced samples, provide genetic information and counseling to selected study participants, and complete our study of the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on study participants.","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

While effective treatments exist, many patients fail to respond to the first treatment, requiring additional trials, and even fewer remit fully. We need better methods for matching patients with the treatments that will work best for them. The goal of this project is to identify genes that contribute to treatment outcome in major depressive disorder. Outcomes studied include treatment response (improvement in symptoms over time), remission (complete recovery), and treatment-emergent adverse events. We also seek to better understand why some depression is resistant to treatment and how social and biological factors such as ancestry, anxiety, treatment withdrawal, medication tolerability, and genetic differences contribute to treatment resistance.The results may provide new insights into the genetic determinants of treatment response in major depressive disorder and may also shed light on genes contributing to risk for this common condition, with the promise of novel treatment approaches and improved targeting of existing therapies. What we learn from this study may enable a more personalized approach to antidepressant treatment, enhancing recovery while reducing costs and side effects. Strong evidence from family and twin studies demonstrates that major depressive disorder (MDD) is heritable, yet there has been limited progress in identifying the actual genes involved. A separate, perhaps overlapping set of genes is expected to play a role in individual variation in treatment response in MDD. By use of a variety of genetic tests, we seek to characterize patients who differ in their response to standard antidepressant treatments.","NCT00088699In the first years of this project, candidate gene studies implicated a few genes in treatment outcome and other genes in adverse effects. We also participated in a meta-analysis of three genome-wide association studies of antidepressant outcome. Despite greater power of this combined sample to uncover association with common genetic markers, no genome-wide significant associations were found. We concluded that no common alleles of large effect on antidepressant outcome exist in these samples.In recent years, we have been using  high-throughput sequencing methods to test for rarer genetic variants that may exert larger effects, at least in patients with treatment resistant depression (TRD). Sequencing of the coding regions of the genome (exome) has now been completed on over 250 treatment-resistant (TRD) or ""typically responsive"" patients drawn from the STAR*D, the Univ. Michigan Depression Center, and NIMH studies of novel antidepressants such as ketamine and scopolamine. Some exome sequencing was carried out at the NIH Intramural Sequencing Center with funds provided by the NIH Clinical Center Genomics Opportunity (CCGO) program, which also provided exome sequence from about 200 non-psychiatric patients for comparison. To increase power, we have obtained exome sequence data from over 2,000 healthy controls available through dbGAP. In the past year, we completed extensive data harmonization and quality control procedures and carried out analyses at the single variant and gene levels. No variant was  found to be significantly associated with TRD after correction for multiple testing, however, 3 genes did show an excess of rare variants. Ongoing work is aimed at confirming these results and extending the analysis to sets of genes representing relevant pathways, such as genes involved in risk for major depression, drug metabolism, or other psychiatric disorders. In collaboration with Carlos Zarate and colleagues, and with the help of the NHLBI Stem Cell Core, we have also undertaken a series of studies aimed at characterizing the impact of antidepressant medication on gene expression and cellular morphology in human neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. Early results from experiments with a metabolite of ketamine suggest that the drug changes expression of a large number of genes involved in regulation of cellular growth and development. We are currently carrying out similar assays using other novel antidepressants in order to test the hypothesis that some novel antidepressants act through common, or overlapping, downstream mechanisms or signaling pathways.Taken together, these studies may identify genes and biological pathways robustly associated with resistance to anti-depressant treatment. Such genes could provide important clues about how to develop more effective antidepressant therapies in the future.","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

With this technique, miniscule doses of a radioactively labeled drug are administered to a subject. The drug travels to the brain and binds to specific target sites, called receptors. The distribution and density of these targets in the brain can be measured with a PET camera. Although some of the PET radiolabeled drugs might be used for diagnostic purposes, the major use of these agents is to study the pathophysiology of disease.","Studies were conducted under the following NationalClinicalTrials protocols: NCT02743377, NCT03912428, NCT03324646, NCT04396873, NCT03958630, and NCT04582916.1) Evaluation of novel PET radioligands for imaging cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2For several years, we have focused on developing much-needed, effective, sensitive, and reliable radioligands to image neuroinflammation. For instance, in 2017, we developed radioligandsnow widely usedfor the 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO). Our recent efforts have focused on the cyclooxygenase (COX) system, which comprises two isoforms, COX-1 and COX-2. Both are important targets for neuroinflammatory biomarkers in neuropsychiatric disorders.Recognizing that in vivo imaging of COX-1 and COX-2 could be a powerful tool for assessing neuroinflammatory response, we recently developed two PET radioligands: 11CPS13 for COX-1 and 11CMC1 for COX-2. In human and nonhuman primate whole blood assays, PS13 was highly potent and selective for COX-1 compared to COX-2, and MC1 was highly potent and selective for COX-2 compared to COX-1. As reported in past annual reports, we previously found that 11CPS13 had excellent in vivo selectivity in animal studies. With regard to 11CMC1, we previously found that it was the first PET radioligand to successfully image and quantify COX-2 upregulation in living nonhuman primate brain after lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation. In a subsequent study, higher 11CMC1 uptake was observed in the symptomatic joints of patients with rheumatoid arthritis compared to healthy controls. In nonhuman primate brain, specific binding of 11CMC1 was markedly increased after repeated LPS injection, while that of 11CPS13 was unchanged.Building on this work, we investigated whether 11CPS13 could be used to quantify constitutive levels of COX-1 in healthy human brain. Brain test-retest scans with concurrent arterial blood samples were obtained in 10 healthy participants of both sexes. In the brain, 11CPS13 showed highest uptake in the hippocampus and occipital cortex. There was no radiometabolite accumulation, and shorter scans were able to reliably measure distribution volume. A significant correlation was observed between distribution volume and COX-1 transcript levels, indicating that 11CPS13 binding reflects actual COX-1 density in the human brain.These results from the first-in-human evaluation of the ability of 11CPS13 to image COX-1 in the brain justifies extending the study to disease populations with neuroinflammation. For instance, because 11CPS13 selectively binds to COX-1 over COX-2, it can be used to measure the in vivo potency of NSAIDs to inhibit radioligand binding to COX-1 in organs of the body.Taken together, this work suggests that, in both nonhuman primates and humans, 11CPS13 and 11CMC1 can be used to measure neuroinflammation. As the first radioligands to act directly on COX-1 and COX-2, 11CPS13 and 11CMC1 can be used to measure COX-1 in healthy conditions and COX-2 in inflammatory disorders. They can also be used to assess drug delivery and in vivo selectivity in therapeutic trials of NSAIDs. Together, they provide a powerful new research tool for the study of mental disorders associated with neuroinflammationincluding dementias and MDD.2) Development of 18FPF-06445974 to quantify phosphodiesterase 4B in living human brain.Phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) metabolizes and thereby terminates the actions of the second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Rolipram is a reversible PDE4 inhibitor, and 11C(R)-rolipram binding is positively correlated with cAMP signaling. As described in previous annual reports, our laboratory found that 11C(R)-rolipram binding was globally decreased in unmedicated patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) experiencing a major depressive episode compared to healthy volunteers. As a follow-up, we found that, in individuals with MDD, two months of treatment with an SSRI antidepressant increased (normalized) 11C(R)-rolipram binding compared to pretreatment values. 11C(R)-rolipram binds to all four subtypes of PDE4: 4A, 4B, 4C, and 4D. While we previously found that the sum of all PDE4 subtypes was decreased during a major depressive episode, some subtypes could be decreased and others increased even though the sum total of all subtypes was decreased. We thus sought to establish whether PDE4B, specifically, is decreased during a major depressive episode in unmedicated MDD participants. Such a result would provide a rationale to test a PDE4B inhibitor in MDD patients in the future.In collaboration with Pfizer and the Karolinska Institutet, we developed the novel radioligand 18FPF-06445974, which is preferential for PDE4B in brain, and investigated its characteristics in rats, nonhuman primates and, for the first time, humans. A concomitant goal was to determine whether 18FPF-06445974 could accurately quantify PDE4 in human brain. Two human participants (one male, one female) underwent two whole body PET scans for radiation exposure dosimetry and three brain PET scans for specific PDE4B quantification. In one male nonhuman primate, four PET whole body scans were performed on different days. The first scan was acquired under baseline conditions, and rolipram (1.0 mg/kg), a PDE4 inhibitor, was administered IV in the second scan. The same baseline and blocked paradigms were repeated with PF-06445974 (0.1 mg/kg) as the blocking drug. Finally, brain PET scans were conducted in four rats. 18FPF-06445974 readily entered human brain and showed widespread distribution, with lower binding in cerebellum. Distribution volume was highest in thalamus and striatum, broadly matching human brain RNA expression. Whole-body imaging in the two humans and one nonhuman primate showed early distribution in the blood pool, accumulation in target organs, and excretion via urinary tract. Both drugs substantially blocked brain uptake in nonhuman primate blocking scans; at 60 minutes, rolipram blocked 78% of uptake, and PF-06445974 blocked 92%. However, for the rolipram-blocked scan, radioactivity in brain increased after 20 minutes and returned to baseline by the end of the scan. Rats showed a similar pattern. To assess whether this was due to radiometabolite in brain or rapid rolipram clearance, a second rolipram dose was injected as a displacing agent at 120 minutes in a rat that had undergone pre-injection of 1 mg/kg iv. This repeat rolipram dose replenished rolipram concentrations in brain and restored its ability to block radioligand binding, proving that no radiometabolite entered rat or nonhuman primate brain. Taken together, the findings demonstrated that 18FPF-06445974 successfully imaged and quantified PDE4B in human brain without radiometabolite contamination, establishing it as a valuable tool for future neuropsychiatric studies. Work is ongoing to investigate whether PDE4B levels are elevated in the brains of individuals with MDD experiencing a major depressive episode compared to healthy volunteers, and whether these levels correlate with clinical rating scales, an index of disease severity.","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

Depression is more disabling than most of the other chronic medical illnesses. Our lab has been a pioneer in ketamine research and demonstrated that ketamine, a glutamatergic modulator, produces a rapid antidepressant, anti-anhedonic (restores diminished pleasure), antisuicidal effect, and anti-fatigue effects (within hours) in patients with suicidal thinking, bipolar depression, and treatment-resistant depression. Our work led to FDA approval of intranasal Esketamine for the indications of 1) treatment-resistant depression and 2) depressive symptoms in major depressive disorder and acute suicidal ideation or behavior. Such conditions are major public health concerns. The improvement to standard treatments usually takes 6 weeks or longer. The finding of rapid antidepressant effects with ketamine within hours in treatment-resistant depression is a major breakthrough and has created significant interest, across stakeholders, in developing drugs that have a rapid onset of antidepressant action (efficacy within hours), and is effective in treatment-resistant conditions. We are now examining the mechanisms of action of efficacy to ketamine in major depressive disorder, bipolar depression, and suicidal ideation, and are searching for biomarkers of this rapid antidepressant and antisuicidal response. Identifying the neural signatures of rapid antidepressant response to ketamine would help develop other treatments that also result in rapid antidepressant and antisuicidal effects.Predictors and neural correlates of antidepressant response to ketamine: protocols 04-M-0222 (NCT00088699), and 17-M-0060 (NCT03065335).Aims 1) To identify the neural correlates of the rapid antidepressant effect of ketamine in subjects with treatment-resistant depression, 2) To identify the biomarkers that are associated with response and relapse to ketamine in patients with major depressive disorder, and 3) To identify the relevance of AMPA receptors in ketamine response.Primary Outcome Measure: clinical, imaging (magnetic resonance imaging/spectroscopy), electrophysiological (magnetoencephalography (MEG), electroencephalography (EEG)), neuropsychological, and biochemical (e.g., genetics, microRNA, BDNF, metabolomics). Change in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total scores.","Our results indicate that the glutamatergic system is involved in the mechanism of action of rapid antidepressant response. In addition, this system may be a feasible target for developing treatments that have rapid and robust efficacy in individuals who have treatment-resistant depression and suicidal thoughts. We found that the glutamatergic modulator ketamine resulted in rapid, robust and relatively sustained antidepressant, antisuicidal, and antianhedonic effects. Response with ketamine occurred within 2 hours and lasted approximately 1 week. Study: (Biomarkers of rapid response in major depressive disorder): protocols 04-M-0222 (NCT00088699), 17-M-0060 (NCT03065335), and 19-M-0107 (NCT 03973268).OBJECTIVE: To identify the neural correlates and cellular and molecular targets of rapid antidepressant response to the NMDA antagonist ketamine in subjects with major depressive disorder. Aims are 1) to examine the antisuicidal effects of ketamine, and 2) to examine correlates of antidepressant response to ketamine in both major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder and include these data/outcome measures: clinical (e.g., family history), imaging (magnetic resonance imaging/spectroscopy), electrophysiological (magnetoencephalography MEG, electroencephalography EEG), neuropsychological, and biochemical (e.g., genetics, microRNA, BDNF, metabolomics), 3) To demonstrate more robust neuropharmacodynamic effects measured by neuropharmacodynamic imaging (fMRI+EEG and MEG) of ketamine 0.5 mg/kg as compared to placebo administered over 40 minutes, and 4) To understand the involvement of AMPA receptors in ketamine's antidepressant response.Secondary aims: To determine if increases in synaptic plasticity, using electrophysiological measures in response to TMS and in association with sleep (i.e., slow wave sleep EEG activity) are associated with better antidepressant response.Results in the past year:1. Fine-tuning neural excitation/inhibition for tailored ketamine use in treatment-resistant depression.Ketamine has been shown to rapidly reduce depressive symptoms in patients with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (TRD). Although its mechanisms of action are not fully understood, changes in cortical excitation/inhibition (E/I) following ketamine administration are well documented in animal models and could represent a potential biomarker of treatment response. Here, we analyze neuromagnetic virtual electrode time series collected from the primary somatosensory cortex in 18 unmedicated patients with TRD and in an equal number of age-matched healthy controls during a somatosensory 'airpuff' stimulation task. We demonstrate that the Poincar diagram offers classification capability for TRD patients, in that the further the patients' coordinates were shifted (by virtue of ketamine) toward the stable (top-left) quadrant of the Poincar diagram, the more their depressive symptoms improved. The same relationship was not observed by virtue of a placebo effect-thereby verifying the drug-specific nature of the results. We show that the shift in neural dynamics required for symptom improvement necessitates an increase in both excitatory and inhibitory coupling. We present accompanying MATLAB code made available in a public repository, thereby allowing for future studies to assess individually tailored treatments of TRD. 2. Ketamine and attentional bias toward emotional faces: dynamic causal modeling of magnetoencephalographic connectivity in treatment-resistant depression.Ketamine rapidly reduces depressive symptoms in individuals with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder. This double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled study analyzed data from 19 drug-free individuals with TRD and 15 healthy volunteers who received a single intravenous infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) as well as an intravenous infusion of saline placebo. Magnetoencephalographic recordings were collected prior to the first infusion and 6-9 h after both drug and placebo infusions. Ketamine administration led to faster gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) transmission in the early visual cortex, faster NMDA transmission in the fusiform cortex, and slower NMDA transmission in the amygdala. Ketamine administration also led to direct and indirect changes in local inhibition in the early visual cortex and inferior frontal gyrus and to indirect increases in cortical excitability within the amygdala. Finally, reductions in depressive symptoms in TRD participants post-ketamine were associated with faster -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) transmission and increases in gain control of spiny stellate cells in the early visual cortex. These findings provide additional support for the GABA and NMDA inhibition and disinhibition hypotheses of depression and support the role of AMPA throughput in ketamine's antidepressant effects. 3. Pharmacological and behavioral divergence of ketamine enantiomers: implications for abuse liability.Ketamine, a racemic mixture of (S)-ketamine and (R)-ketamine enantiomers, has been used as an anesthetic, analgesic and more recently, as an antidepressant. However, ketamine has known abuse liability (the tendency of a drug to be used in non-medical situations due to its psychoactive effects), which raises concerns for its therapeutic use. (S)-ketamine was recently approved by the United States' FDA for treatment-resistant depression. Recent studies showed that (R)-ketamine has greater efficacy than (S)-ketamine in preclinical models of depression, but its clinical antidepressant efficacy has not been established. The behavioral effects of racemic ketamine have been studied extensively in preclinical models predictive of abuse liability in humans (self-administration and conditioned place preference CPP). In contrast, the behavioral effects of each enantiomer in these models are unknown. We show here that in the intravenous drug self-administration model, the gold standard procedure to assess potential abuse liability of drugs in humans, rats self-administered (S)-ketamine but not (R)-ketamine. Subanesthetic, antidepressant-like doses of (S)-ketamine, but not of (R)-ketamine, induced locomotor activity (in an opioid receptor-dependent manner), induced psychomotor sensitization, induced CPP in mice, and selectively increased metabolic activity and dopamine tone in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of rats. Pharmacological screening across thousands of human proteins and at biological targets known to interact with ketamine yielded divergent binding and functional enantiomer profiles, including selective mu and kappa opioid receptor activation by (S)-ketamine in mPFC. Our results demonstrate divergence in the pharmacological, functional, and behavioral effects of ketamine enantiomers, and suggest that racemic ketamine's abuse liability in humans is primarily due to the pharmacological effects of its (S)-enantiomer.4.

The incidence is between one in 7500 and one in 20,000 live births. With its unique profile of striking behavioral features, such as hypersociability, and differential impact on cognitive functions, some only mildly affected while others, particularly visuospatial construction, severely impaired, WS is an intriguing experiment of nature that raises fundamental questions about the neurogenetic mechanisms of social behavior and of cognition, the modularity of mind, and brain plasticity in development. Because the genes involved in WS are known, the study of neural mechanisms in WS affords a privileged setting for investigating genetic influences on complex brain functions from the bottom-up. Studying this rare genetically-based neurodevelopmental disorder allows us to closely examine the genetic determinants of the function, structure, and organization of neural systems relevant to cognition and behavior, including, particularly, 1) the neural basis of genetically-determined visuospatial construction abilities and 2) the neural mechanisms by which genetic factors influence social behavior and cognition. Our studies compare high functioning groups of people with genetic abnormalities in the Williams syndrome region of chromosome 7 with healthy individuals matched for age, sex, and handedness, and with similar IQ. By thus controlling for IQ, we minimize the possibility that factors such as intellectual disability or developmental level would influence interpretation of brain results. Working within this model human system extends and complements efforts to understand genetic mechanisms of behavior, and its pathologies, in the general population and in neuropsychiatric disorders where contributions of individual genes are small and phenotypes may be subtle and complex.Our studies of the neurobiology of WS are a five-pronged effort:1) In individuals with the full WS hemideletion (only one copy of affected genes), we continue to refine our knowledge of the WS brain phenotype in terms of cortical and sub-cortical structure and function2) In individuals with smaller hemideletions, we apply our multimodal imaging battery to better link components of the neurobiological phenotype with specific genes.3) By additionally studying individuals with duplications of the WS critical region (Dup7), we can identify brain and behavioral phenotypes showing gene-dosage effects, i.e. those associated with having one copy (WS), two copies (typically developing children), or three copies (Dup7) of the WS critical region. In contrast to individuals with WS, who display hypersociability and visuospatial impairments, Dup7 has been statistically related to autism and relative strengths in visuospatial skills.4) Using our knowledge of the WS brain phenotype as a template, we continue to explore the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in WS-related genes in the general population.5) Our longitudinal multimodal neuroimaging of high functioning children with the full WS deletion, smaller deletions, and duplications (Dup7) of the WS critical region is a major initiative. Here, we document the development of the genetically-driven anomalies of brain structure and function in these disorders in order to better understand neurogenetic mechanisms. Our experience and success in defining the WS brain phenotype, together with the collaborative and in-house expertise in neurodevelopment, provide a unique opportunity to make major advances in this area.","The Clinical and Translational Neuroscience Branch continues to work toward discovery of novel genetic contributions to brain structure, function, and clinically relevant behavior and cognition through a series of ongoing multimodal neuroimaging studies of individuals with copy number variation in the 7q11.23 Williams Syndrome (WS) genomic region (hemizygous microdeletion or duplication of a contiguous segment of DNA at this locus). These studies have been responsible for seminal advances in elaborating the neural underpinnings of both visuospatial and socio-emotional aspects of the 7q11.23 phenotype. Via multiple neuroimaging techniques, including voxel- and surface-based cortical morphometry, diffusion tensor imaging, functional MRI, we have established that the visuospatial construction deficits in WS are linked to convergent intraparietal sulcus alterations. Specifically, in this brain region, we have shown that individuals with WS harbor disrupted neural integrity, altered activation during spatial judgments, gray matter volume and sulcal depth reductions, and associated neural fiber tract anomalies. Similarly, in pursuit of systems-level correlates of the hypersociability and non-social anxiety observed in WS, we have found decreased amygdala activation evoked by viewing pictures of faces with fear-inducing content and, conversely, increased amygdala response to non-social frightening pictures, abnormalities that were linked to altered prefrontal regulation in structural equation models. We have also identified convergent alterations in anterior insula structure, function, and inter-regional connectivity that predict the characteristic WS personality. Efforts this year have focused on data collection of these same structural and functional measurements of visuospatial and socio-emotional systems integrity, with additional measurements of myelination based on mcDESPOT acquisitions, in a growing cohort of children with and without WS critical region copy number variation (i.e., individuals with one in WS, two in typically developing TD, or three in Dup7 copies of affected genes) as part of our longitudinal WS neurodevelopmental initiative.In proof-of-concept work aimed at establishing neurostructural gene-dosage effects, we have found increasing overall brain size (Dup7>TD>WS) but decreasing relative cerebellar size (WS>TD>Dup7) with copy number of affected genes. Interestingly, both of these Dup7 phenotypes (larger brain size and relatively smaller cerebellum) have been described in the autism literature, particularly in boys, although these findings are not without controversy. Following this work, we are undertaking similar gene-dosage analyses of more localized morphometry throughout the brain, as well as local gyrification index and resting-state whole-brain connectivity, the latter using a connectome-wide association study approach as well as independent component and dual-regression analyses.In pursuit of understanding the heterogeneity across individuals with copy number variation in the Williams Syndrome genomic region, we have embarked on studies of the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms and genetic haplotypes in the remaining or duplicated strand of the region. We have developed novel methods to achieve specialized genotyping from SNP-chip data and applied these methods in proof-of-concept work testing the hypothesis that common variation in the ELN gene (and not other 7q11.23 genes) would predict clinically meaningful abnormalities of aortic structure. We were able to generate haploid and triploid genotype calls across the affected region and identified a single nucleotide polymorphism associated with aortic stenosis in WS participants and protection from aortic dilation in Dup7 participants. Ongoing work will focus on understanding how sequence variation within the WS region predisposes to variability in neural phenotypes, such as above-mentioned macrostructural characteristics that we have observed to be associated with 7q11.23 copy number variation in a gene-dose dependent manner.Preliminary data from our WS developmental cohort has already demonstrated parietal hypofunction during visuospatial challenge along with altered social network activation during processing of socially salient stimuli, consistent with the hypothesis that both visuospatial and social neurobiological differences in WS are rooted in early life. Recently in this cohort, we have uncovered atypical patterns of intraparietal sulcus functional connectivity in WS, which feature diminished cooperativity with visual networks but, in contrast, enhanced social brain network linkage. This work offers a neural circuit-based view of how these diverse visuospatial and social circuits integrate in the context of 7q11 copy variation and in the context of the behavioral characteristics of this population (Gregory et al., 2019).We have also formalized our longitudinal analysis methods and have made available to the neuroimaging community a software tool  to address some of the challenges of analyzing longitudinal neuroimaging data (Chen et al., 2021).  In addition, we have established processing pipelines for the diverse array of neuroimaging data types being collected.  Overall, this project seeks not only to expand knowledge of the WS-related brain systems in childhood, but also to identify developmental trajectory (throughout childhood) and gene dose-response characteristics of neural abnormalities underlying visuospatial and socio-emotional alterations in this syndrome using a longitudinal, repeated measures design.

Our studies focus on affective disorders distinguished by their appearance during periods of reproductive endocrine change (i.e., reproductive mood disorders RMDs). These disorders are prevalent and accompanied by considerable morbidity. Postpartum depression (PPD) occurs after approximately 15% of deliveries (and, therefore, approximately 300,000 to 500,000 US women are at risk each year), it is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality associated with childbirth, and it has deleterious effects on infants, including poor health and lower cognitive function. Similarly, the 2013 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) report ranks premenstrual syndrome and major depression as the 26th and 30th (respectively) of the 59 most prevalent chronic disorders worldwide. Unlike depressive illness accompanying endocrinopathies (e.g., hypothyroidism), RMDs have been shown in our prior work to represent a differential behavioral sensitivity to an otherwise normal reproductive endocrine stimulus. Thus, RMDs offer a unique opportunity to identify underlying mechanisms of affective dysregulation: i.e., we can demonstrate that a change in steroid level precipitates symptoms in women at risk, but the underlying susceptibility that transforms a normal endocrine signal into an abnormal behavioral response is as yet undetermined. Additionally, the role of reproductive steroids in the pathophysiology of these conditions could lead to the development of novel therapeutics as recently demonstrated in clinical trials of neurosteroids (e.g., brexanolone) in PPD. In our studies of women with RMDs our objectives are threefold: First, to identify the nature of the hormonal triggers in each of these mood disorders (i.e., premenstrual dysphoric disorder PMDD, perimenopause-related depression PMD, and postpartum depression PPD); Second, to characterize the physiologic systems (e.g., brain networks, neural hubs) targeted by ovarian steroids, changes in which could accompany symptoms in these conditions and, possibly direct future efforts to target these brain systems with neuromodulatory interventions (e.g., transcranial direct current stimulation tDCS); Third, to identify the underlying genetic and cellular substrates that contribute to the differential behavioral response to ovarian steroids that we demonstrate in women with these disorders. We employ both naturalistic study designs in which we examine the effects of sex steroids on brain function during natural hormone transitions (i.e., across the menstrual cycle, during the puerperium, and during the perimenopause), and experimental paradigms using hormone receptor agonists and antagonists, in which we recapitulate or block critical reproductive events. Finally, our investigations of the determinants of behavioral sensitivity to ovarian steroids have directed our attention to the pubertal transition, a developmental stage when hormone sensitivity could be programmed (see ZIAMH002933-06).","This report includes work arising from the following clinical protocols: NCT00005011, NCT00056901, NCT00059228, NCT00082043, NCT00100360, NCT00001177, NCT00001259, and NCT00001481.The studies conducted within this project are relevant to our understanding of womens behavioral health, sex differences in psychiatric illness and the course of affective disorders in general. The innovation in our work is both conceptual as well as applied. In the past, RMDs were considered to be hormone excess or deficiency states, prompting treatments to correct these inferred hormonal imbalances. We address critical mechanistic questions about the role of reproductive hormones on brain function and behavior in RMDs. We employ steroid receptor modulators to isolate and characterize the effects of specific steroids on behavior in both women with RMDs and well-characterized asymptomatic controls. These clinical studies have demonstrated that a change in steroid hormone secretion induces affective symptoms in most women clinically diagnosed with RMDs, but the identical hormonal intervention has no effect in asymptomatic controls. The alteration in affective state in RMDs represents an abnormal behavioral response to normal physiology. Thus, our work has reframed the understanding of these conditions from hormonal excess or deficiency states to that of ovarian steroid-sensitive behavioral states (i.e., atypical endocrinopathies). We also employ both multimodal neuroimaging studies and cellular models to investigate the physiologic basis of the hormone sensitive phenotype in RMDs. We have characterized neuronal hubs that are differentially regulated by ovarian steroids in women with RMDs, developed a steroid metabolomics platform to examine the steroid metabolome in PMDD, demonstrated an impact of genotypic variation in steroid-regulated genes on the central nervous system (CNS) response to steroids (in a brain region-specific manner), and identified underlying cellular mechanisms for the alterations in steroid signaling in both PMDD and PMD (the mechanisms underlying several of which are being actively pursued). These findings are unique and serve to inform our understanding of the pathophysiology of these conditions and their potential comorbidities, their clinical management and use of hormone therapies. Finally, having developed and tested these methods in women with RMDs, we will employ these techniques in our new studies of postpartum psychosis  a condition potentially lethal to both mother and child.Findings to date include: 1) the differential affective and behavioral response to normal physiologic events in women with PMDD compared with control women  a behavioral phenotype in which we have explored the underlying biologic risks. 2) We have identified the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (SGCC) to be differentially regulated by ovarian steroids in women with PMDD compared with control women (i.e., regional cerebral blood flow rCBF during a resting state exam is decreased during estradiol or progesterone exposure when PMDD symptoms recur). The degree of altered rCBF also correlated with gene expression in the ESC/E(Z) pathway of genes  a family of genes which we previously identified to be differentially expressed (increased) in cell lines from women with PMDD compared to controls, and members of which are differentially regulated by estradiol and progesterone in cell culture (see below).  3) In collaboration with Dr. David Goldman at NIAAA, we developed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) and human induced-pluripotent cell lines (h-IPSCs) from women with and without PMDD who had participated in our GnRH agonist-induced ovarian suppression studies. The behavioral outcomes observed during these protocols serve to refine the hormone-sensitive phenotype beyond simply the established clinical diagnoses. Our in vitro experimental strategies attempt to recapitulate the endocrine events that trigger mood symptoms in women with PMDD. In our first study, pathway analyses of the LCL transcriptome revealed, among others, over-expression of ESC/E(Z) complex genes (an ovarian steroid-regulated gene silencing complex) in untreated LCLs from women with PMDD, with more than half of these genes over-expressed as compared to controls. In contrast, protein expression of ESC/E(Z) genes was decreased in untreated PMDD LCLs. Finally, mRNA expression of several ESC/E(Z) complex genes were increased by P in controls only and decreased by E in PMDD LCLs. These findings provided the first evidence of a plausible biological substrate for the differential behavioral response to E/P in women with PMDD. Indeed, these data suggest that women with PMDD have an intrinsic abnormality in their epigenetic capacity that could manifest in an alteration in their ability to translate environmental events into long-term changes in gene expression. We have continued to pursue these findings in PMDD. During the past year we have pursued both the mechanism underlying the altered expression of the ESC/E(Z) pathway and the effects of ovarian steroid exposures on gene expression in PMDD versus controls. First, preliminary evidence from a whole small RNA sequencing (targeting micro-RNA expression) shows a significantly increased expression of several micro-RNAs in LCLs from women with PMDD compared to those in controls. Additionally, several of these differentially expressed micro-RNAs target the ESC/E(Z) pathway, and, therefore, could contribute to the observed dissociation between increased expression of the ESC/E(Z) pathway genes and decreased protein levels of this same pathway in PMDD. Additionally, several of these micro-RNAs target the other genes relevant for both affective dysregulation and tissue-specific steroid signaling including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Second, we performed transcriptomic analyses of LCLs derived from women with PMDD and asymptomatic controls cultured under untreated (steroid-free), estradiol-treated, and progesterone-treated conditions. Weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) of transcriptomes identified four gene modules with significant differences in the response patterns in women with PMDD (versus control LCLs) that also differed across hormone exposures, including one enriched for neuronal functions. Exploratory enrichment analysis of hub genes underlying neuronal enrichment signals revealed multiple pathways governing intracellular Ca2+ dynamics. Next, in a gene-level analysis comparing transcriptional response to hormone across diagnoses, a statistical model (i.e., generalized linear model) identified 1522 genes differentially responsive to estradiol (E2-DRGs). Among the top 10 E2-DRGs was an interacting gene network (NUCB1, DST, GCC2, GOLGB1) involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi function. qRT-PCR validation reproduced a diagnosis by hormone interaction (reflecting differential expression patterns in LCLs from women with PMDD compared with those from controls during estradiol exposure), for NUCB1, a regulator of cellular Ca2+ and ER stress. Finally, we used a thapsigargin (Tg) challenge to test whether estradiol induces differences in Ca2+ homeostasis and ER stress response in PMDD. Untreated PMDD LCLs had a 1.36-fold decrease in Tg-induced XBP1 splicing response (a measure of intracellular calcium signaling) compared to controls, and a 1.62-fold decreased response in the E2-exposed condition. These data suggest that estradiol-dependent aberrations in cellular Ca2+ dynamics and ER stress may contribute to the pathophysiology of PMDD and could guide treatment development to focus on medications regulating intracellular calcium signaling (known to be involved with affective state regulation) in PMDD.","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

Our approach has been as follows: First, to examine how ovarian steroids modulate neurocircuitry and HPA axis function in asymptomatic control women; Second, to evaluate the neuroregulatory impact of interactions between ovarian steroids and common functional variants in specific genes in which there is biological evidence that the gene expression is both regulated by ovarian steroids (e.g., BDNF) and impacts CNS function; Finally, to determine whether the effects of ovarian steroids on neural circuitry and HPA axis differ in women with PMDD. In our gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist studies, we have been able to examine directly the effects on brain activation of acute hypogonadism and individual ovarian steroid replacement in women employing both oxygen-15 water (H215O) PET and functional MRI (fMRI) (i.e., both PET and fMRI scans are performed during each of the three hormone conditions i.e., hypogonadism and two replacement conditions). Ultimately, to understand the influence of ovarian steroids on affective regulation, these effects must be studied at a circuit level of modulation. Consequently, we have explored the impact of ovarian steroid availability and withdrawal on regional brain activation and functional connectivity. Additionally, we employ the GnRH agonist experimental paradigm to confirm the presence or absence of an ovarian steroid-sensitive phenotype (e.g., PMDD women who experience a remission of symptoms during ovarian suppression, a recurrence of PMDD when ovarian hormones are added back, as well as controls who experience no changes in mood across the menstrual cycle and during the hormone manipulation paradigm. In collaboration with Dr. Karen Berman, we demonstrated that ovarian steroids affect rCBF during cognitive stimulation for the first time in women, In this study, GnRH agonist-induced hypogonadism, estradiol and progesterone differentially activated  Wisconsin Card Sort-related regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and hippocampus. We have pursued our original findings by augmenting H215O PET imaging with fMRI. Each technique has advantages for this work, and conjointly they can provide important converging and complementary data. In both our PET and fMRI studies we examine several measures of brain function including resting state activity, cognitive and affective activational paradigms, and functional connectivity to investigate circuit level functions. We employ several different activation paradigms during the neuroimaging procedures, which allows us to test neural circuits relevant to the phenomenology of affective disorders (i.e., reward system, default mode network).The specific goals for this project include the following: 1) Examine the effects of ovarian steroids (or their neurosteroid metabolites) on measures of behavior, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function, and regional cerebral blood flow. 2) Determine the effects of sex steroids on the prefrontal reward systems, serotonin transporter function, and on those brain regions implicated in the pathophysiology of mood disorders (i.e., prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus). 3) Investigate the role of sex steroids in sex differences in cognitive test performance. 4) Examine gene expression in women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) and controls in cell lines to better understand the cellular basis of the differential behavior response to ovarian steroids.","This report includes work arising from the following clinical protocols: NCT00026832, NCT00100360, NCT00001177, and NCT00001322.Evidence  suggests that genomic variation in sex-steroid receptors or in the systems regulated by sex steroids may contribute to the ovarian hormone-sensitivity observed in PMDD. Thus, as a first step, we examined the effects of common genetic variations in women during each of the hormonal conditions established within the GnRH agonist-induced hypogonadism and ovarian steroid addback protocol. We have tested specific, common functional variants (BDNF Val66Met and COMT Val158Met) that are regulated by sex steroids and that are known to alter brain function. In our studies, therefore, we employ these gene variants as probes for the impact of genetic substrates on the effects of ovarian steroids on womens brain function.A post hoc sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the effects of both BDNF and COMT genotypes were only evident in the presence of estradiol, and the differences in WM-related rCBF were brain region-specific: the effects of COMT genotype were only observed in the DLPFC regardless of the BDNF genotype, whereas the differences in rCBF between the BDNF genotype were confined to the hippocampus regardless of the  COMT genotype. Overall, the findings from these studies demonstrate that in women, variations in genes putatively regulated by ovarian steroids impact functional neurocircuitry in a brain-region- and hormone-specific manner  here, specifically, interactions between BDNF and COMT genotypes and estradiol on the activation of functional neurocircuitry in the hippocampus (where BDNF is highly expressed) and the DLPFC (where COMT has primacy for dopamine trafficking), respectively. Although sex steroids display pleiotropic effects within the CNS, their actions are often tissue-specific and reflect the effects of local tissue-specific regulators that facilitate sex steroid signaling in one tissue and inhibit or repress the signal in another tissue. Our findings demonstrate how genetic context could modulate the regulatory actions of sex steroids on the functions of specific brain regions involved in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric conditions, including the PFC and hippocampus. Additionally, these data suggest that effects of genes or hormones may not be identified if examined in isolation, given the impact of their interactions. These findings also have clinical relevance for understanding the neurobiological basis of individual differences in the cognitive/behavioral effects of ovarian steroids in women, and may provide a neurogenetic framework for understanding neuropsychiatric disorders related to reproductive hormones as well as illnesses with sex differences in disease expression. Finally, we will probe the roles of variation in sex steroid-regulated genes on brain development across puberty, a time when the brain is re-exposed to sex steroids at gonadarche. Our functional genomic studies in cell lines from both women with and without PMDD have pursued our initial findings of altered function of the ESC/E(Z) gene complex in PMDD as follows: First, neuroprogenitor cells (NPCs) were successfully differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) made from women with PMDD and control women (confirmed by immunofluorescent staining and transcriptome analysis). Overlapping gene expression between lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) and NPCs reveals that several genes and gene pathways potentially important for PMDD pathophysiology are expressed in both. Indeed, both LCLs and NPCs show signatures of differential gene silencing through similar mechanisms at baseline and in response to ovarian steroids. These findings in NPCs reveal neuronal differences between women with PMDD and controls both at baseline and after ovarian steroids, including ESC/E(Z) targets. Second, we employed two stock neuronal cell lines: Luhmes Cells, which are immortalized neuronal precursor cell lines (both undifferentiated/neuronal precursors and differentiated/mature dopaminergic neurons), as well as SH-SY5Y, an immortalized neuroblastoid cell line characterized by an adrenergic and dopaminergic phenotype. Both stock neuronal cell lines contained evidence of ESC/E(Z) gene complex function and responsivity to ovarian steroids. Thus, these data provide strong supportive evidence of the neural relevance of our initial findings in lymphoblastoid cell lines (immune-origin tissue) in several more pathophysiologically-relevant tissues (i.e., human NPCs, two stock neuronal cell lines). Finally, we have evidence that the transcriptomic response to ovarian steroid exposure differs between undifferentiated stock neuronal cells, NPCs and that observed in mature, differentiated neuronal cell lines. These latter findings may provide a model to examine the differential effects of ovarian steroids on neuronal measures during development compared with those during adulthood (and further demonstrates the importance of developmental stage and context on the neural effects of sex steroids).","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

Synapses are assembled between presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons during early brain development. They are rearranged to optimize the connectivity of neural circuits during brain maturation, and are modulated in strength, size and number by experience during cognitive, emotional and behavioral processes. The ability of a synapse to change its structure and function is called synaptic plasticity, which is critical for proper brain development and function. Many mental disorders, including schizophrenia, autism, depression, and anxiety disorders are believed to stem from defective synaptic function and synaptic plasticity during brain development and/or following adverse experience. The goal of this project is to identify the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity and synapse development, to gain insights into the mechanisms of synaptic pathology associated with mental disorders, and to facilitate the development of new preventive and therapeutic strategies for mental illnesses.","1. The BAD-BAX-Caspase-3 cascade modulates synaptic vesicle pools via autophagySynaptic vesicles undergo exocytosis to release neurotransmitters when the presynaptic membrane is depolarized by action potentials. After exocytosis, vesicles are retrieved by endocytosis and recycled to form new synaptic vesicles. The number of synaptic vesicles at a synapse is an important factor determining synaptic strength, which is dynamically regulated during development and by experience. A stable, yet flexible, pool of synaptic vesicles is critical to ensure the reliability and adaptability of neural circuits. Although synaptic vesicles have been intensively studied, how their number is maintained and regulated remains largely unclear. Emerging evidence suggests a role of macroautophagy (autophagy hereinafter) in the life cycle of synaptic vesicles. Rab26, a small GTPase enriched on synaptic vesicles, also localizes to autophagosomes, and its overexpression induces large vesicular clusters containing synaptic-vesicle and lysosomal proteins; activation of autophagy by inhibitors of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) reduces the number of synaptic vesicles. Autophagy is a cellular process through which proteins and organelles are delivered to lysosomes for degradation. Autophagy removes defective proteins and organelles under physiological conditions and serves as a prosurvival mechanism by recycling nonessential cellular constituents under cellular stress, such as starvation and growth factor withdrawal.We previously showed that the BAD-BAX-caspase-3 cascade is a canonical apoptosis pathway and has a nonapoptotic function in long-term synaptic depression at the postsynaptic site. During this reporting period, we show that, at the presynaptic site of hippocampal neurons, the BAD-BAX-caspase-3 pathway inhibits autophagy, which in turn controls the size of synaptic vesicle pools. Moreover, the regulation of autophagy by caspase-3 influences activity-induced depletion, and recovery of synaptic vesicle pools and facilitates learning and memory. This study identifies a new mechanism for the control of synaptic vesicle pools, and a new, nonapoptotic function of the BAD-BAX-caspase-3 pathway in presynaptic terminals. Additionally, it indicates that autophagy is not only a homeostatic mechanism to maintain the integrity of cells and tissues, but also a process engaged by neural activity to regulate synaptic vesicle pools for optimal synaptic responses, learning, and memory. 2. Dysbindin-1 regulates mitochondrial fission and gamma oscillationsMitochondria are vital organelles in eukaryotic cells. Neuronal mitochondria are motile and undergo fission and fusion. Mitochondrial fission is mediated by the dynamin related GTPase Drp1. During mitochondrial fission, cytosolic Drp1 is recruited to mitochondria, binds to adaptors on outer mitochondrial membranes, and assembles into oligomers to constrict and sever mitochondrial membranes. The ratio of mitochondrial fission to fusion is increased by neural depolarization.Mitochondria generate 90% of cellular ATP in neurons. They are essential for synaptic transmission, an energy-demanding process accounting for 41% of ATP consumed in the rat cortex and even more in the primate cortex. A neurons energy expenditure is proportional to the frequency of synaptic transmission. Neural activities at higher frequencies are more mitochondria-dependent. Gamma oscillations are high-frequency (20100 Hz), synchronized activities of neural populations that require strong mitochondrial functions. They are present in many brain areas and underlie the precise timing of neuronal discharges and coherent binding of neural ensembles for information processing during cognitive functions. The mechanism for generating gamma oscillations is best characterized in the hippocampal CA3 region where both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmissions are required for gamma oscillations, and the oscillating local field potentials (LFPs) mainly originate from perisomatic inhibitory currents in pyramidal neurons. The power of gamma oscillations is dependent on the ability of excitatory neurons to rapidly repolarize postsynaptic membranes after each synaptic input. Pumping out ions flowing into excitatory postsynaptic neurons to repolarize membrane potentials accounts for 50% of ATP used for synaptic transmission. Despite the recognized importance of mitochondria in gamma oscillations, little is known about how mitochondria accommodate the rapid, local increase in energy demands imposed by gamma oscillations at the postsynaptic site of excitatory neurons. Dysbindin-1 is a coiled-coil domain-containing protein decreased in the brains of people with schizophrenia. It regulates the subcellular distribution of dopamine D2, D3 receptors, the NMDA receptor subunit GluN2A, necdin, and BDNF, as well as glutamate release, neural excitability, and synaptic plasticity. Dysbindin-1 is present on mitochondrial outer membranes. It is unknown, however, whether dysbindin-1 affects mitochondria. During this reporting period, we show that dysbindin-1 regulates mitochondrial fission by promoting Drp1 oligomerization on mitochondria. Neuronal activation in the gamma band induces the translocation of dysbindin-1 to mitochondria where it interacts with Drp1 and the Drp1 receptor Mid49 and Mid51 to increase Drp1 oligomerization and mitochondrial fission. This process is required for gamma oscillations. Dysbindin-1 null mice (sdy) have reduced mitochondrial fission, which leads to deficits in gamma oscillations and novel object recognition (NOR). Notably, these deficits can be alleviated by increasing mitochondrial fission with a light-inducible mitochondrial fission system. These findings reveal an unsuspected role of dysbindin-1 in mitochondrial dynamics and gamma oscillations This study sheds new light on the physiological function of mitochondrial fission and cellular mechanisms of gamma oscillations.3. The Dorsal Raphe regulates the duration of attack through the medial orbitofrontal cortex and medial amygdalaThe dorsal raphe (DR) nucleus is one of the raphe nuclei located on the midline of the brainstem. It is a phylogenetically conserved structure and plays a role in various types of aggressive behaviors, such as maternal and territorial aggression in rodents. The role of the DR in aggression is complex and context dependent. For example, infusion of glutamate in the DR increases the frequency of attack bites against a conspecific, but with no effect on threatening behavior. Conversely, infusion of glutamate receptor agonists increases bite latency and decreases bite frequency in maternal aggression, with no effect on chasing behavior. Knockdown of tyrosine receptor kinase receptors in DR neurons decreases latency to attack. Prepartum lesion of the DR decreases the frequency of attack in maternal aggression, while postpartum lesion of the DR decreases the duration of an individual attack bout. The DR contains a heterogenous population of neurons that release one or a combination of the neurotransmitters including serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT), dopamine, glutamate and GABA. The prefrontal cortex and amygdala are densely innervated by the DR. During this review period, using an in vivo optogenetic approach, we show that CaMKIIa neurons in the DR are activated by attack and that these neurons modulate the duration of attack behavior toward an intruder through two projection areas. Specifically, the DR-medial OFC (MeOC) pathway prolongs an already occurring attack, while the DR-MeA pathway shortens it. These findings reveal two DR-mediated neurocircuits that have divergent functions in aggressive behavior.","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

It is increasingly recognized that microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in the posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression during brain development. miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that primarily repress gene expression by destabilizing mRNAs or inhibiting translation. miRNAs function in differentiation, development and plasticity of neurons. miRNA expression in the brain is developmentally regulated and correlates with cortical maturation. Dysregulation of miRNA expression is detrimental to the brain. For instance, miRNA deficiency in mice causes aberrant synaptic protein expression, synaptic transmission, dendritic spines, learning and memory. miRNAs have been implicated in schizophrenia. Mutations in genes encoding miRNAs or components in the miRNA biogenesis machinery are associated with increased risk for schizophrenia. miRNA expression is altered in the brains of schizophrenia patients. In our earlier study, we compared the expression of miRNAs in the postmortem brains of participants with and without schizophrenia. We found that miR-936 is increased in dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of subjects with schizophrenia. The current objective of this project is to investigate the function of miR-936 in neural development and synaptic physiology.","Numerous studies have shown that the brains of people with schizophrenia have anomalous gene expression which may arise from dysregulation of gene expression. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate translation. They bind to mRNAs, usually at the 3 untranslated region, to suppress translation or destabilize mRNAs. miRNAs play a role in a variety of neuronal processes including the structure and function of synapses. Postmortem studies show that miRNAs in the DLPFC are altered in schizophrenia. It is possible that miRNAs are involved in neural maturation and synaptogenesis of the DLPFC and that miRNA alterations may contribute to the development of schizophrenia. Characterizing the functions of miRNAs altered in schizophrenia, therefore, may provide insights into the molecular mechanism of schizophrenia.We previously analyzed miRNA expression using next-generation sequencing in the postmortem DLPFC of individuals affected with schizophrenia. We found that miR-936 is increased in the DLPFC of individuals with schizophrenia using next-generation sequencing. This increase is likely caused by the disease rather than antipsychotics as there is no correlation between miR-936 expression and psychiatric medications. miR-936 is a primate-specific miRNA with a distinct developmental profile in the human DLPFC, which is low in toddlers and high in adolescents. During this reporting period, we validated miR-936s expression change in an independent cohort, examined the laminar and cell-type distribution patterns of miR-936 in the human DLPFC and its function in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived glutamatergic neurons (iNs). We analyzed the effect of altered miRNA expression on the basic biophysical properties, miniature and evoked synaptic responses, and synapse number in these neurons. We show that miR-936 in the human DLPFC is enriched in cortical layer 2/3 and expressed in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons. miR-936 is increased from layers 2 to 6 of the DLPFC in schizophrenia samples. In human iNs, miR-936 reduces the number of excitatory synapses, inhibits AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission, and increases intrinsic excitability. These effects are mediated by its target gene TMOD2. These results indicate that miR-936 restricts the number of synapses and the strength of glutamatergic synaptic transmission by inhibiting TMOD2 expression. miR-936 upregulation in the DLPFC, therefore, can reduce glutamatergic synapses and weaken excitatory synaptic transmission, which underlie the synaptic pathology and hypofrontality in schizophrenia.","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

Current theory holds that these parts of the brain process the feedback that results from decisions, and that the brain uses this feedback to improve future decisions. The OFC, MFC and amygdala also play a key role in emotional and autonomic responses and in the recognition of emotions in other people. Accordingly, to achieve the goal of understanding mental health disorders at the level of brain mechanisms, we seek to understand how the OFC, MFC and amygdala process feedback, produce decisions, and generate both autonomic and emotional responses. Achievement of this overarching goal requires a combination of neurophysiological and neuropsychological methods. The specific objectives of this project are therefore: (1) to delineate how neurons in the OFC and MFC signal changes in expected feedback; (2) to study the neurophysiological interaction between the amygdala and both the OFC and MFC as subjects make decisions based on predicted feedback; (3) to examine the role of the amygdala, OFC and MFC in producing emotional responses in anticipation of and in reaction to feedback.","Neurons in both the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and medial frontal cortex (MFC) encode the sensory properties, magnitude and subjective value of expected and received rewarding outcomes. In addition, the activity of neurons in these regions reflects anticipatory arousal, as measured by pupil diameter.Decision-making and representations of arousal are intimately linked. How these processes interact at the level of single neurons as well as neural circuits are unknown. To understand how OFC and MFC influence arousal and decision making, we recorded neural activity from both regions while animals made reward-guided decisions. Heart rate (HR) was recorded as a proxy for arousal. In intact animals we found that higher HR facilitated reaction times (RTs). Concurrently, a set of neurons in OFC and MFC selectively encoded trial-by-trial variations in HR independent of reward magnitude. After amygdala lesions, HR generally increased and the relationship between HR and RTs was reversed. Concurrent with this change, there was an increase in the proportion of MFC neurons encoding HR. At the population level, the balance of encoding in MFC shifted towards signaling HR, suggesting a specific mechanism through which arousal influences decision-making.As a step to develop a method to study affect and mood regulation, we measured heart rates of animals while they performed tasks in which different fluid reward amounts were cued. Heart rate was measured with a pulse oximetry sensor. Animals were trained on a choice task in which different visual cues signaled different magnitudes of fluid reward. A fixed set of 7 cues was associated with fixed amounts of fluid, ranging from 0.15 ml to 1.05 ml. A trial began when the subject pressed a central button for 1.5 s. Then two visual cues, pseudo-randomly selected from the set, were presented for 1.5 s, one on each side of the monitor. The animal could choose the cue on the left or right side of the screen by selecting and pressing either the left or right button, respectively, after which a 1.5-s waiting period ensued. At the end of the waiting period, the fluid reward amount associated with the chosen cue was delivered. The temporal separation of the cue period and reward delivery ensured that any change in heart rate during the cue period could not be attributed to breath holding or other reward consumption activities. We found that the heart rates increased as the reward amount became larger. The changes in the heart rate began to occur approximately 500 ms after the cue onset. The heart rates during the cue period were analyzed with a regression model which included variables such as the location of the larger reward, choice direction, reaction time and the amount of the larger reward. The heart rate during the cue period was significantly related to the amount of the larger reward (t-test; p < 0.01), but not to the reaction time (p > 0.05). Our results show that heart rate can be modulated fast enough to reflect trial-by-trial changes of attention, arousal or motivation.",There were no publications during this reporting period,"[('Andrew Rattin Mitz, PhD Section on Neurophysiology', 'Section on Neurophysiology')]",,

Patients with major depressive disorder, for example, show altered cerebral blood flow in all three of these brain structures. Furthermore, dysfunctional interactions of the OFC and the MFC with the amygdala are thought to underlie these disorders, at least in part.Much of our information about brain structure and function is derived from studies that employ functional neuroimaging, electrophysiology, and either molecular or genetic methodologies. The results that these methods provide are correlational in nature, not causal, and therefore can establish structure-function relationships in only a provisional way. The lack of a causal analysis hampers any attempt to translate research findings into improvements in a patient's quality of life. In the absence of causal knowledge about the underlying pathophysiology, and especially about the localization of functions disrupted in mental health disorders, treatments of these diseases typically affect the whole brain. Targeted interventions, such as deep brain stimulation (DBS), when they have been attempted at all, have lacked a strong theoretical foundation. A better understanding of the structural underpinnings of emotion and valuation is therefore essential for progress in this area.Given the links between mental health disorders and altered function in the OFC, MFC, and the amygdala, there is a clear need for an improved understanding of their role in learning, decision making, and emotion in both health and disease.The overarching goal of this project is to develop an understanding of the functional interactions among the amygdala, the OFC and the MFC in value-based decision making. Accordingly, our work examines the specific and collective contributions of these three key components of the limbic system to reward and emotion. The specific objectives of this project are: (1) to elucidate the role of the amygdala, the OFC and the MFC in reward processing, valuation and emotion; (2) to understand the selective contributions of the OFC and the MFC to value-based decision making; and (3) to explore therapies that might ameliorate the symptoms of major depressive disorder and other disorders of mood and anxiety.","Lesion studies suggest dissociable functions of medial prefrontal cortex (MFC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), with MFC being essential for social cognition and OFC being essential for value-based decision making. Although bilateral amygdala damage also results in impairments in these domains, it is not known whether the dissociable functional roles of MFC and OFC critically depend on interactions with the amygdala. To test this possibility, we compared the performance of animals with crossed surgical disconnection of the prelimbic cortex, a subregion of MFC, and amygdala (MFC x AMY) and animals with surgical disconnection of the OFC and amygdala (OFC x AMY), to a group of controls (CON). All animals were assessed for food-retrieval latency while viewing videos of social stimuli (a test of social interest) and object choices based on current food value (devaluation task, a test of value-based decision making). Compared to the CON group, group MFC x AMY, but not group OFC x AMY, showed significantly reduced latencies to reach for a reward in the presence of videos of conspecifics, indicating reduced social valuation and/or reduced social interest. In a test of value-based decision making, however, the opposite pattern was observed; group OFC x AMY, but not group MFC x AMY, displayed severe deficits on object choice following selective satiation. These data indicate that MFC and OFC interact with the amygdala to subserve distinct behavioral contributions in the domains of social valuation and object valuation, respectively. That these prefrontal-amygdala circuits are functionally dissociable lends support to the idea that MFC and OFC make independent contributions to cognitive appraisals of the environment. The MFC has been identified as encoding not only reward value but also features of conspecifics and of oneself. Physiological studies in animals and fMRI studies in humans have identified MFC as supporting social cognition. Relatedly, a growing body of evidence suggests that some species find the sight of another individual receiving a reward reinforcing, called vicarious reinforcement, and that this capacity is supported by a network of brain areas including the MFC. Indeed, single neurons in MFC selectively code reward delivery to the self, a partner, both animals, or neither animal.We used a vicarious reinforcement task to measure prosocial tendencies in animals. Two animals participated in each test session: an actor and a recipient. Actors learned that three different visual cues mapped onto three distinct reward outcomes: to Self, the Other animal, or Neither animal. On each trial, actors saw a cue that predicted one of the three juice offers and could accept the offer by making a saccade to a peripheral target or reject the offer by breaking fixation. All six actors displayed prosocial preferences, indicated by their greater tendency to give reward to Other relative to Neither.Analyses of autonomic arousal have been increasingly used to contextualize and guide neural research, especially for studies of reward processing. We therefore collected pupil diameter while animals performed the vicarious reinforcement task. Contrary to our expectations, we found that pupils were widest in anticipation of juice to the self, moderately-sized in anticipation of juice to nobody, and narrowest in anticipation of juice to a social partner. The seemingly paradoxical pupil effect can be explained by a model in which pupil size tracks outcome salience, prosocial tendencies track outcome valence, and the relation between salience and valence is U-shaped. Although ACC lesions disrupted animals social decision making, as evidenced by altered acquisition of prosocial tendencies, there was no effect on autonomic arousal in anticipation of those same outcomes. Thus, our results indicate that the ACC is not part of the neural circuitry responsible for producing the socially modulated pupil response seen during vicarious reinforcement.","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

First, we aim to elucidate how neural processing in the brain changes during the course of learning or training to perform specific tasks or skills. Second, we are investigating how learning can be modulated (for example, through feedback) and establishing the brain mechanisms that underlie such effects. By combining these two goals we hope to provide insight into how learning and training may be used to ameliorate the effects of dysfunction in the nervous system. To achieve these goals we use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure both structure (gray matter, white matter) and function in the brain of participants performing specific tasks and compare those findings with behavioral measures of performance. Understanding the neural mechanisms of learning and the capacity for brain plasticity is vital for enhancing learning and for the development of rehabilitative therapies.","The primary goals of this research are i) to establish how learning impacts the structure and function of the brain, and ii) to determine how learning can be modulated. 1) Impact of experience on representation of expert tools in the brain (NCT00001360)The idea that when we use a tool we incorporate it into the neural representation of our body (embodiment) has been a major inspiration for philosophy, science and engineering. While theoretically appealing, there is little direct evidence for tool embodiment at the neural level.Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated whether expert tool users (London litter pickers) represent their expert tool more like a hand (embodiment) or less like a hand (differentiation), as compared to a group of tool novices. During fMRI scans, participants viewed videos depicting grasps performed by either a hand, litter picker or a non-expert grasping tool.We measured the patterns of response in brain regions known to represent hands and tools (occipitotemporal cortex and parietal cortex) and found differences in the representational structure of hands and tools between experts and novices. Contrary to the embodiment theory, we find that experts represent their own tool less like a hand, providing an important alternative framework to the prominent tool embodiment theory.2) Modulating learning - Impact of prosthesis training on hand representations (NCT00001360)As described above, we found that expert tools become more differentiated from the representation of the hand (i.e. less embodied), and a similar result has been found for prosthetic limbs in amputees. However, the development of prosthetic devices emphasizes embodiment as the goal with the design and the control of devices becoming more biomimetic (mimicking the body). In this context it is notable that there are low rates of prosthetic hand usage and even complete device rejection are common in upper-limb amputee populations. If experience with a device does not lead to representing it more like a real body part, then maybe the quest to design artificial hands that look and act in the same way as the human body is misguided and may actually hinder usage. Here, we are investigating how different training regimens, and in particular intuitive (biomimetic) versus arbitrary control mechanisms, impact the representation of prosthetic and real hands. We are training able-bodied participants to use an artificial hand simulator, similar to a prosthesis, that can be strapped to the forearm and controlled via electromyographic (EMG) readings from the arm. Participants are trained with either a biomimetic control system (matching robotic hand movements to real hand movements) or an arbitrary control system (matching robotic hand movements to arbitrary real hand movements). We are measuring the impact of these different training regimens by collecting extensive behavioral and fMRI measures before and after training.Establishing the nature, degree and consequences of plasticity in the adult cortex provides important insights into the potential for rehabilitative brain therapies following injury or dysfunction in the nervous system.","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

It was only in the past two decades that clinicians and researchers have begun to routinely peer inside the human brain to assess the neural mechanisms of cognitive function. Neuroscientists now use results from such experiments to describe the functional organization of networks within the brain, and to talk about their disruption during psychiatric disorders. It is important to point out, however, that while the fMRI signal provides a measure of local neural activity, this measure is only indirect, as it is transmitted through the regional regulation of blood flow. Thus there is always a need to understand how this surrogate signal reflects neural activity across the brain. For basic research, fMRI offers an inherent trade-off compared to other methods, such as electrophysiological recordings that offer a more spatially detailed and temporally precise portrait of neural activity. Its main advantage is its broad spatial coverage of localized brain activity, which electrophysiological measures cannot achieve.Our research employs multiple approaches to elucidate the nature of fMRI mapping and its relationship to underlying neural activity. First, we study how local blood flow responses relate to the diversity of signals among neurons packed densely within a small volume, such as a single MRI voxel. Second, we ask how spontaneous neural activity patterns from a single point in the brain relate to the well-described correlational networks commonly observed in fMRI studies of functional connectivity. Third, during fMRI scanning we manipulate brain activity, through reversible inactivation or optogenetic stimulation, in neuromodulatory structures such as the basal forebrain to understand the extent to which such input shapes local fMRI responses. Fourth, we contribute to the establishment of anatomical atlases and frameworks for charting brain areas using MRI methods. In our research program, we combine neural recordings and temporary inactivation with fMRI signals measured in paradigms that range from resting wakefulness to complex cognitive tasks.","The mapping of activity in the brain using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has become among the most important tools for both basic neuroscience research and clinical studies of brain disorders. At its core, fMRI represents a readout of local changes in blood flow that is most often derived from local changes in neural activity. Since blood flow and neural activity operate by entirely different principles, pinpointing their specific connection has been elusive and seems to depend on a number of factors. This is not surprising, for how can one make a one-to-one mapping between a specific pattern of activity among millions of neurons in a voxel to a slow change of single scalar values measured as the local the hemodynamic signal? Frustrating as the problem is, the topic is of great importance, since any clues about the link to local neural activity or ascending neuromodulation can have wide-reaching consequences for interpreting results in humans, including in psychiatric patients. While our laboratory does not focus on the study of neurovascular coupling per se, we do undertake experiments that bring new insights into the interpretation of the hemodynamic fMRI signal. For example we are studying the nature of local neural diversity of in the spiking responses to different types of signals, and how this bears on the hemodynamic responses from the same voxel or area. We are also investigating the relationship between activity in large-scale functional MRI networks across the brain to local neural activity measured at a single position.In the past year, we have made great progress using natural stimuli to understand aspects of the brain's functional organization that was difficult to ascertain using either single unit recordings or fMRI mapping.  Several years ago, we demonstrated that during the free viewing of naturalistic videos reliably stimulated the visual system, such that the neural activation time course throughout the visual brain was consistent across multiple presentations.  However, when we measure the activity of face patch neurons within a given voxel, there was a remarkable diversity of neural contributions.  Neighboring neurons were often independent in their response time courses.  How does this local heterogeneity shape the fMRI time courses?  In the past year, we have drawn a surprising conclusion from studies in which we mapped fMRI activity based upon single neurons.  Namely, in its natural mode of operation, the visual cortex is not composed of discrete, functionally homogeneous areas that process stimuli in a stepwise fashion. Instead, more broadly specialized regions are pervaded by parallel functional subnetworks, which contribute to the functioning of multiple brain areas. The operational division of labor, therefore, is not segregated spatially across the cortical surface, but is instead shared by subnetworks of neurons inhabiting faraway areas.  This study, which combined fMRI and neural recordings, is due to be published shortly.A related study from our lab asks whether the spontaneous covariation of fMRI and neural signals during rest matches is similarly uncorrelated, and whether the spontaneous maps of a neuron match its visually driven maps. For this we simultaneously recorded  single-unit and fMRI responses inside the MR scanner. As the technical hurdles associated with this type of work are immense, we needed to o develop and acquire MR-compatible electrodes, microdrive, suitable RF coils, preamplifiers, cables, and filters to achieve such simultaneous recording. In the past year, we have discovered that, in contrast to visual responses, the fMRI mapping of spontaneous activity is more homogeneous and more restricted across cortical and subcortical areas.  The two studies together aim to provide insight into the nature of fMRI responses, including the local neurovascular relationship, as well as the network layout principles of high-level vision.  In the past year, we have also taken steps to extend this work to the study of the  basal forebrain, a small area that projects broadly to the cerebral cortex. We previously showed the basal forebrain is centrally involved in regulating spontaneous signals throughout the telencephalon during rest. This structure may be a particularly important contributor to fMRI signals across the brain, including the brain-wide networks that are commonly studied in clinical research.","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

We are particularly adept at using vision to guide our social perception and action, and deficits in these capabilities, as is common in certain psychiatric and neurological disorders, can be debilitating. Within the cerebral cortex, many discrete areas are dedicated to the processing of socially relevant stimuli, such as faces, bodies, expressions, and actions. At the single neuron level, social fluency is reflected in the tuning of spiking responses to these and other types of stimuli. The brains responses to social stimuli is a composite system, with some responses likely driven by genetic predisposition, since newborns respond to visual social signals, and others shaped very gradually through experience and development.A prominent focus of our research is the social circuitry of the cerebral cortex, which we study using both electrophysiological and functional imaging methods. We have developed different methods to ask questions about how the human brain is specialized for social information. Gaining deeper insights into operational principles of social circuits and pathways is directly relevant to human psychiatric disease, which is more often than not plagued by deficits in social perception or behavior. In past years, we have developed new tools, including realistic avatar stimuli, to systematically study aspects of face processing in the brain. Further, we continue to elucidate the relationship between individual neurons in face patches and network activity across the brain during natural visual experience.","Individuals vary in their social skills.  This is because the core operations of social perception, memory, abstraction, and behavior derive from specialized brain circuits that are shaped through abundant experience during childhood and beyond. These circuits can, in some cases, dissociate from other parts of the brain serving similar functions.  For example, damage to very specific parts of the temporal lobe can lead to the inability to recognize individual faces while not affecting the recognition of other objects. Damage in other areas can leave subjects with a difficulty in recognizing facial expression, voice intonation, or even prompt them to believe that their spouse is an impostor. Understanding this specialization at a neural level has made steady progress, since the discovery approximately 50 years ago that individual neurons respond selectively to faces, and sometimes to individual faces. Following the addition of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the field of social neuroscience has greatly advanced, and much has been learned about the circuits underlying social perception. Importantly, this research has a direct bearing on a wide range of patients, as social perceptual deficits are a hallmark of many psychiatric illnesses.A key element of social vision is its adaptability.  In our laboratory, we employ methods that allow us to track neural activity patterns over time, including days, weeks, and even months.  This set of tools, which includes functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), single-cell recordings, and optical recordings, allows us to study how visual perceptual learning of social stimuli is expressed in the brain. We have focused much of this work on face patches, which are small, circumscribed regions of the temporal and prefrontal cortex showing greater fMRI responses to faces than to other categories of stimuli. The longitudinal nature of our studies allows us to investigate plasticity over multiple time scales.  This research has been further aided by our development of an avatar face stimulus, whose animation, facial expressions, and environmental context is under complete experimental control. This stimulus toolbox has been of great use for systematically studying the factors that determine neural firing, for example in the context of the geometry of natural vision. In the past year, we have published papers related to important aspects of face perception.  For example, we have provided evidence that the recognition of facial identity utilizes learned, internal representation of the average face (Koyano et al, 2021).  This normative stimulus shapes the responses of neurons across face patches, highlighting the distinctive, and hence recognizable, facial features.  The brains use of norms for face recognition was originally hypothesized based on psychophysical studies.  Our demonstration of a clear neural representation of the average face within the face patch system bolsters this view and suggests a more general mode by which the brain gathers and stores information through its natural experience.In a different study, which is complete and now nearing submission, we have taken an entirely different approach to understanding the determinants of neural responses to faces.  In this study, we investigated critical facial elements for driving neurons in different face patches. In this study, facial elements are randomly intermixed on different images, for example with the eyes from one individual presented randomly with the mouths, heads, and bodies from many other individuals. One striking result from this combinatorial approach has been the extent to which a very small region of a given face can determine the neuron's response, and the extent to which responses to this important feature are robust to major changes to the scene. For example, neurons responding selectively to one set of eyes often continue to respond to those eyes even when they are placed within a different face, which is attached to a different body and placed in a different scene. The local domination of such features was surprising, particularly as they were measured from the same neural populations as the norm-based coding findings mentioned above.In a third study (Khandhadia et al, 2021), we investigated whether auditory stimuli are associated with visual stimuli in face patch neurons.  In that study, we found that two anterior face patches responded very differently to the vocal track being added to the corresponding animated face.  In one area (face patch AM), commonly held to be critical for face recognition, the acoustic content had no influence whatsoever on the visual responses.  However, in another area (face patch AF), most cells were significantly influenced by the acoustic content, so long as it matched the visual content.   This study demonstrate the previously unknown integration of sensory social signals within the face patch system.Finally, analyses are presently underway to use Ca++ fluorescence imaging to study cellular responses in face patches. Similar to the microelectrode recordings, these recordings also permit longitudinal tracking over weeks and months. Thus, our Ca++ fluorescence work will also be used to investigate whether neurons in face selective areas modify their response profiles as the subjects learn new faces.","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

In particular, we are interested in the role of learning and experience. To achieve this goal we measure behaviorally how well people can recognize or learn to recognize different objects, faces, body parts (e.g. hands, feet, legs) or scenes and then use functional brain imaging to measure changes in brain activity as participants perform different visual tasks on these stimuli (NCT00001360). Determining how the brain learns to extract information about ourselves, others and objects from the complex input captured by the eyes provides important insights into our perception of the world we see. Such knowledge is critical for understanding the deficits in perception and social behaviors that accompany many mental health and neurological disorders.","The goal of this research is to understand how we see what we see: how does the brain analyze the light falling on the retina of the eye to reveal a world full of objects, people and things?During the past year we have continued to focus on both (i) perception and (ii) memory of complex visual stimuli, in particular real-world visual scenes, objects and people (NCT00001360).Perception:Real-world scenes are incredibly complex and heterogeneous, yet we are able to categorize them and identify objects and people within those scenes effortlessly. While prior studies have identified brain regions that appear to be specialized for processing faces, object and scenes, it remains unclear what the precise roles of these different regions are and what information they contain.One of the major challenges in understanding visual perception in the brain is the wide range of different objects and scenes that we experience. Despite this breadth, studies often focus on a small number of hand selected object or scene categories, but it becomes unclear how representative any subsequent findings are. To overcome this challenge we developed a large-scale database (THINGS) of 1,854 diverse types of object sampled systematically from concrete picturable and nameable nouns in the American English language. This database provides a rich resource of object concepts and object images and offers a tool for both systematic and large-scale naturalistic research in the fields of psychology, neuroscience, and computer science.We used this database in a large-scale behavioral experiment using online crowdsourcing, sampling 1.46 million trials in more than 5,000 participants. Using a computational model of the task, we were able to identify 49 core dimensions of our internal mental representations of objects, providing a comprehensive and fine-grained characterization of this representational space.This work provides a critical framework for investigating the underlying neural representations of objects. We have now collected extensive fMRI and MEG data on images from the THINGS database. Our ongoing analyses aim to investigate how the fundamental dimensions identified in behavior are reflected in brain activity over both space and time.These results provide important insights into the cognitive processes supporting our understanding of objects. Memory:To understand the nature of object and scene memory, we have focused on two specific issues:1) Relationship between activity elicited during perception and memoryDuring memory recall, cortical reinstatement is thought to occur as an echoing of the neural patterns elicited during encoding. However, the precise information represented in these recall traces is relatively unknown, with previous work primarily investigating either broad distinctions (e.g. scenes versus objects) or specific individual images (e.g. exemplars of chair, hat), rarely bridging these levels of information. Here, we conducted an in-depth comparison of encoding and recall along a spectrum of granularity, from a coarse level (scenes, objects) to a mid level (e.g., natural, manmade scenes) to a fine level of individual categories (e.g., living room, cupcake). We found that there is decodable information at all levels of granularity in category-selective visual cortex. However, information during recall was primarily at the coarse level, with fine level information in some areas; there was no evidence of mid level information, suggesting a different representational structure to that during encoding. Further, we found some degree of segregation between those voxels showing the strongest effects during encoding and those during visual recall with the peaks of encoding-recall similarity in regions anterior to category-selective cortex. Collectively, these results demonstrate that while there are some similarities between representations during perception and recall, as highlighted in many prior studies, there are also clear differences that need to be elaborated.2) Elucidating the content of scene memoryWhen we recall a previously experienced event, what exactly are we remembering? Are our memories a precise, high-definition recording of that event, a low-resolution gist of that memory, or even just a verbal description of what we saw? Answering this question is an essential component of being able to tease apart the mechanisms of memory: what information is encoded and maintained, how memory decays over time, and what information is retrieved from these memories.In a series of studies, we have been investigating the content of memory for real world scenes using a drawing task. Participants study scenes and then after a delay, draw those scenes in as much detail as possible from memory. The resulting memory-based drawings are scored by thousands of online observers, revealing numerous objects, few memory intrusions, and precise spatial information. We have studied both young volunteers as well as people who claim to have no visual imagery (termed aphantasia). Further, we have investigated a common distortion that occurs in memory in which the boundary of the scene is either extended or contracted.Our findings show that not only is it possible to quantify the content of memory during free recall, but that those memories contain detailed representations of our visual experiences (although memory distortions may still occur). Aphantasic participants recalled significantly fewer objects than matched controls, with less color in their drawings, and an increased reliance on verbal scaffolding. However, aphantasic participants showed high spatial accuracy equivalent to controls, and made significantly fewer memory errors. These differences between groups only manifested during recall, with no differences between groups during the matched perceptual condition. This object-specific memory impairment in individuals with aphantasia provides evidence for separate systems in memory that support object versus spatial information. Elucidating how the brain enables us to recognize objects, scenes, faces and bodies provides important insights into the nature of our internal representations of the world around us. Understanding these representations is vital in trying to determine the underlying deficits in many mental health and neurological disorders.","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

The long-term goal of this project is to understand the functional architecture of face processing in the primate brain using a variety of neurobiological techniques, including functional brain imaging (fMRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG), single-cell recording, deactivation (both acute and chronic), electrical stimulation, and pharmacological manipulation. Whenever possible, results from humans are compared to those from monkeys, so that cross-species comparisons are possible. Because recognizing facial identity and facial expressions is crucial for appropriate social interactions, a better understanding of the neural mechanisms for face processing should have a major impact on the treatment of disorders of social cognition, such as autism, schizophrenia, and anxiety. This work was conducted under protocol 93-M-0170 (NCT00001360) and 12-M-0128 (NCT01617408).","Lesions of inferior temporal (IT) cortex in humans can result in the syndrome termed prosopagnosia, an inability to recognize familiar faces. Single-cell recordings from IT cortex of monkeys have revealed the existence of neurons that are selectively activated by visual images of faces. Additionally, fMRI of both human and monkey brains has demonstrated face-selective regions, in which the fMRI signal evoked by faces is greater compared to that evoked by non-face objects. Together, these studies point to specialized neural machinery in the primate brain for processing faces. Thus far, our group and others have shown that the neural circuitry for face processing consists of a network of brain regions in the temporal and prefrontal cortex as well as in the amygdala.During the past year, we have made a number of important discoveries regarding the neural mechanisms mediating face processing:1.	FMRI activation at 7T showed that the enhanced response to fearful relative to neutral faces in the primary visual cortex was confined to the superficial layers, consistent with the idea that the processing of facial valence in visual cortex is mediated through feedback projections from the amygdala.2.	Granger causality analysis of MEG data revealed that, during configural face processing but not during featural face processing, dorsal stream visual areas send information to ventral stream visual areas, indicating that visuospatial information is transmitted from parietal cortex to ventral face-processing regions during configural face processing.3.	The results of an fMRI adaptation paradigm showed that changes in facial expression and changes in head orientation engage separate neural substrates within the superior temporal sulcus of macaques, indicating a division of labor within the network of brain regions specialized for processing faces.4.	Behavioral and fMRI results showed that individuals with Moebius Syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by facial paralysis, leads to a specific impairment in processing facial expressions, such that their inability to produce facial expressions dampens their perception of these expressions.5.	FMRI results showed that body selective regions in the macaque brain responded more to images of fearful bodies than neutral bodies when the stimuli belonged to either macaques or humans but not a species that the subjects had no previous real-world experience with.","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

Much remains unknown about the neural bases and behavioral correlates of these pervasive developmental disorders. The major goal of our studies is to utilize neuroimaging technologies (functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI, structural MRI, magnetoencephalography MEG), and neuropsychological instruments (clinical neuropsychological tests, questionnaires, eye-tracking, and specific measures of memory and cognition) to identify the neural correlates of the social and communicative deficits characteristic of ASD individuals in comparison to typically developing participants (TD).  This work was conducted under protocol NCT01031407.","This past year we have continued to evaluate the neural and behavioral characteristics of high-functioning individuals with an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). We have been particularly interested in understanding aberrant eye movement patterns in ASD when confronted with dynamic social stimuli.Extensive study of TD and ASD participants has identified a large number of brain regions associated with our ability to navigate the social world. Although it is widely appreciated that this so-called social brain is composed of distinct, interacting systems, these component parts have yet to be clearly elucidated. In this study we used measures of eye movement and neural typicality (ie., the extent to which each individual TD and ASD participant differed from the norm) while they watched a battery of short movie clips depicting social interactions. Our findings provided evidence for dysfunction in the autistic individuals in two components of the social brain; one underpinning the ability to orient attention to social stimuli, the other underpinning the ability to infer the mental state of others (Ramot et al., Communications Biology, 2020).This study added to a growing body of work indicating that measures of eye tracking provide insights into social processing deficits in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), especially in conjunction with dynamic, naturalistic, freely-viewed stimuli. However, the question remains as to whether eye-gaze characteristics, such as preference for viewing specific facial features, can be considered a stable individual trait, particularly in those with ASD. If so, how much data are needed for consistent estimations? Following up on the study described above (Ramot et al., Communications Biology, 2020), we assessed the stability and robustness of gaze preference for facial features as incremental amounts of movie data were introduced for analysis. To accomplish this we trained an artificial neural network to create an object-based segmentation of naturalistic movie clips (14 s each, 7410 frames total). In the study, 33 high-functioning individuals with ASD and 36 typically developing individuals of similar IQ and age (age range: 12-30 years) viewed 22 Hollywood movie clips, each depicting a social interaction. As we evaluated combinations of one, three, five, eight, and 11 movie clips, gaze times on core facial features became increasingly stable at within-subject, within-group, and between-group levels. Using a number of movie clips deemed sufficient by our analysis, we found that individuals with ASD displayed significantly less face-centered gaze (centralized on the nose) but that viewing times did not significantly differ from typically developing participants when focusing on eyes or mouths. Our findings validate gaze preference for specific facial features as a stable individual trait and highlight the possibility of misinterpretation with insufficient data. Additionally, we propose the use of a machine learning approach to stimuli segmentation to quickly and flexibly prepare dynamic stimuli for analysis (Reimann et al., Autism Research, 2021).","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

Piloting online methods of recruitment for more efficient clinical screening of healthy volunteers, OCD researchers focus on recruiting more diverse populations into research and employ systematic and standardized healthy volunteer characterization measures while also submitting data to publicly available repositories. OCD researchers are able to pivot to study current public health concerns such as COVID-19 and youth suicide.The Psychiatry Consultation Liaison Service (PCLS) is a multidisciplinary team consisting of psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers and trainees that works extensively in collaboration with the Clinical Center (CC) and other Institutes to provide clinical care and perform mental health research. The staff in the NIMH OCD are focused on research, aligned with and contributing to the mission of NIMH to reduce the burden of mental illness, that is focused on the interface between mental and physical health. The three main areas PCLS studies are: 1) suicide risk in the medical setting, 2) mental health aspects of coping with chronic medical illness across the lifespan, and 3) neuropsychiatric aspects of immune and infectious disorders (including HIV/AIDS), autoimmune brain disorders, rare genetic and other medical disorders. In addition, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the PCLS is collaborating with investigators in NIAID to study the long term medical and mental health sequelae of COVID-19 survivors. Since the OCD is primarily focused on the administration of clinical research and training for the overall NIMH intramural research program, most individual research time is conducted through collaborations with NIH intramural and extramural researchers and clinicians to leverage resources for the most impact possible. In addition, all the NIMH Consult Services (PCLS, Neuropsychology Assessment, Neurodevelopmental and Behavioral Phenotyping, and the Sleep and Neurodevelopment Services) work with other CC and IC principal investigators to study the psychiatric co-morbidities associated with various disease states and participate in extensive behavioral and cognitive phenotyping of rare diseases.","NIMH Clinical Research Support: The aim of the Research Volunteer (RV) protocol (17-M-0181) is to recruit and screen adult volunteers in good health for participation in research studies in the NIMH IRP (NCT03304665). The study includes optional brain MRI and MEG that will help build a normative set of scans linked to clinical information collected from healthy RVs. Deidentified data from RVs are broadly shared with other researchers to maximize scientific impact. Study highlights include use of an online website for initial consent and self-report survey measures, followed by an in-person appointment for clinical evaluation for study eligibility. Since the start of the study, 1177 volunteers have consented and undergone initial screening; over 200 have been enrolled and had in-person assessment; more than 152 have had a brain MRI and 68 have had MEG recordings. There is a strong interest by NIMH research groups for referrals of RVs. Recruitment of RVs is ongoing. Data from the study have been submitted to the NIMH Data Archive (NDA) and OpenNeuro repositories. Suicide Risk in the Medical Setting: The Director of NIMH, Dr. Joshua Gordon, established suicide prevention research as an NIMH priority and has a mission to reduce the national suicide rate by 20% by the year 2025. As suicide risk screening is now a national priority for medical settings, non-mental health clinicians require valid, psychometrically-sound screening instruments for assessing suicide risk that have been validated empirically with medically ill patients in hospital settings. Our suicide risk screen study for pediatric patients in the emergency room resulted in such a validated tool, the ASQ (Ask Suicide Screening Questions). Due to public demand, the ASQ has been translated into 16 languages. It is currently being implemented in emergency departments, inpatient medical units and outpatient primary care clinics where it has subsequently been validated in the U.S. and abroad. The ASQ toolkit is on the NIMH website http://www.nimh.nih.gov/ASQ for public use. The expanded toolkit includes materials necessary for hospitals to implement their own suicide risk screening programs and has been updated to include the nation's first Youth Suicide Risk Clinical Pathways for Emergency Departments and inpatient medical surgical units. The ASQ Toolkit has been viewed by the public with over 400,000 unique pageviews and has guided medical practitioners in hospital settings across the country and around the world. We have 5 IRB-approved protocols addressing suicide screening in different medical settings (NCT00623493, NCT02140177, NCT02050867, NCT02830334). Four of the five protocols have completed data collection; we are currently writing manuscripts to disseminate results. We are developing a screening tool for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder and Intellectual Disabilities. We collaborate with the Indian Health Service (IHS) to integrate universal suicide risk screening in all their medical facilities, and with school and detention facilities to assist in their utilization of the ASQ to screen students and inmates, respectively. Our ASQ training team visited an American Indian reservation in Fall 2019 and as a result suicide risk screening is now universal in Whiteriver Hospital. Plans for continuing the pilot in a second AI/AN reservation hospital were delayed due to COVID-19. At the NIH CC, suicide risk screening in adult and pediatric inpatients was initiated successfully. With nationwide concerns that suicidal behavior is on the rise, our public health outreach has increased; we continue to consult on suicide risk screening program implementations across the country. We consult to the NIMH Global Team and the American Academy of Pediatrics to help launch pilot suicide risk screening programs in Ethiopia and Argentina.Mental Health Aspects of Coping with Chronic Medical Illness: Clinical work on the PCLS and Neuropsychology Assessment Service (NAS) has led us to many collaborative research projects with other NIH Institutes. Work with the Pediatric Oncology Branch, NCI, is currently focused on the development and validation of ""Checking In"", a brief electronic interactive screening measure of distress designed to identify emotional, physical, social, practical and spiritual concerns of pediatric patients. Feasibility testing at NIH is completed and we are further testing the instrument with several extramural institutions. OCD researchers also lead and facilitate national efforts to educate patients and families on pediatric catatonia as well as on pediatric somatic symptom disorders and delirium. They are also developing curricula for child psychiatrists on diagnosis and management of mental health concerns in youth with chronic medical illness. Neuropsychiatric Aspects of Immune and Infectious Disorders (including HIV/AIDS), Genetic, and other Disorders: The NAS is involved in a broad range of research protocols studying cognitive and emotional functioning in various medical groups. These research protocols include genetic disorders (such as Mobius syndrome, methylmalonic academia, McCune-Albright syndrome, Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Sub-cortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), Chediak-Higashi syndrome), infectious and immune diseases (HIV, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, Ebola, COVID-19,  anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis and other autoimmune brain disorders presenting with psychosis), brain tumor (re-irradiation effects), and chronic fatigue syndrome. In addition, the NAS also plays a vital role in assisting NINDS researchers who are studying Parkinson's disease, epilepsy and other disorders.Neuropsychiatric studies in HIV-related research activities in the OCD fall into two categories: 1) NIH Intramural NeuroHIV Program, and 2) Collaborations with multi-site research networks, including an NIH DoD HIV/AIDS associated neurocognitive disorder protocol. The NIMH OCD, NINDS and NIAID have developed 2 intramural protocols (NCT01875588; NCT01692236) investigating HIV-related neurocognitive disorders, which are a clinical challenge and threat to the long-term health of people living with HIV/AIDS. In addition, the OCD supports the assessment of mental health needs of HIV/AIDS patients with substance abuse disorders including opiate use disorders in an interdisciplinary approach to HIV and mental health in DC and MD community sites. With NIAID, NIDA, NIA, NICHD, NEI, and NIH Office of AIDS Research, NIMH supports the annual NIH Intramural NeuroHIV Research Workshop (2020), where work on the role of interpersonal and childhood trauma and HIV was presented and published this year. NIMH OCD COVID-19 Research: 1) NIMH is collaborating with NIAID investigators on ""A Longitudinal Study of COVID-19 Sequelae and Immunity"" (Protocol 20-I-0123) and will assist in characterizing mental health states through on-line self-report mental health questionnaires and screening measures, as well as direct clinical evaluations of several hundred patients and healthy volunteers over the next three years. 2) The Mental Health Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on NIMH Research Participants and Volunteers protocol leverages existing NIMH studies to accomplish time-sensitive research on the mental health impact of environmental stressors imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The study will describe the relationship between stressors related to COVID-19 and self-rated measures of mental health symptoms and distress among a range of participants including various patient populations and healthy volunteers. Since the study began in April 2020, 3,000 people have enrolled and completed baseline questionnaires. 3) A COVID-19 adapted suicide risk screening telehealth pathway is available at the ASQ Toolkit website.","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

In addition, the neurobiological effects of treatments and response to these treatments are studied under this project. Moreover, we perform comprehensive phenotyping with the data from all studies conducted in our Branch which includes genetics, neuropsychological testing, structural and functional brain imaging, electrophysiological studies and peripheral blood measures to identify markers of diagnosis and treatment response. Further, we study symptom and syndrome dimensions of depression (RDoC, NIMH Research Domain Criteria). Finally, we conduct proof-of-concept studies under this protocol to identify putative targets for developing novel antidepressants.Studies underway include:1. An Investigation of the Antidepressant Effects of an mGluR2/3 Receptor Antagonist (TS-161) in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).Design: Male and female patients, ages 18 to 65 years, with a diagnosis of MDD, currently in an episode of major depression, will be recruited. This study will consist of the double-blind crossover administration of either TS-161 (mGluR2/3 Receptor Antagonist, 50 or 100 mg/day given orally) or placebo. The study will assess the efficacy of 3 weeks of a mGluR2/3 Receptor Antagonist compared with placebo in improving overall depressive symptomatology in patients with treatment-resistant MDD.Outcome measures: Primary: MADRS total score.2. Neurobiology of SuicideThe aim of this study is to evaluate possible biomarkers of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in individuals currently experiencing a suicidal crisis. In taking a dimensional approach to suicide research, we will be able to study phenomenology across Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) units of analysis, from genes through circuits to self-report and experimental interventions. 3. AMPA receptor activation in the mechanism of ketamine's antidepressant effectsDesign: Male and female patients, ages 18 to 65 years, with a diagnosis of MDD, currently in an episode of major depression, will be recruited. This study will consist of the double-blind administration of perampanel (AMPA receptor antagonist) or placebo in patients who receive ketamine. The study will assess the efficacy of 2 perampanel in blocking ketamine's antidepressant effects.","This Report involves work collected under protocols 01-M-0254 (NCT00024635); 08-M-0196 (NCT00759395); 08-M-0150 (NCT00697268); 14-M-0085 (NCT02122562); 07-M-0021 (NCT00397111); 14-M-0041 (NCT02049385); 07-M-0152 (NCT00472576), 09-M-N230; 15-M-0151 (NCT 02484456), 15-M-0188 (NCT02543983), 19-M-0107 (NCT03973268), and 000101-M (NCT04821271).Results this past year:1. Brain Correlates of Suicide Attempt in 18,925 Participants Across 18 International Cohorts.In a data-sharing project, ENIGMA-MDD, pooled data from 18 international cohorts with neuroimaging and clinical measurements in 18,925 participants (12,477 healthy control subjects and 6448 people with depression, of whom 694 had attempted suicide) were analyzed. We identified 25 regions of interest with statistically significant differences between groups. Post hoc examinations identified neuroimaging markers associated with suicide attempt including smaller volumes of the left and right thalamus and the right pallidum and lower surface area of the left inferior parietal lobe. This study addresses the lack of replicability and consistency in several previously published neuroimaging studies of suicide attempt and further demonstrates the need for well-powered samples and collaborative efforts. Our results highlight the potential involvement of the thalamus, a structure viewed historically as a passive gateway in the brain, and the pallidum, a region linked to reward response and positive affect. 2. Network Changes in Insula and Amygdala Connectivity Accompany Implicit Suicidal Associations.Limited knowledge exists regarding the neurobiology of suicidal thoughts, given that there are currently no direct probes of the suicidal state. This pilot study used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to evaluate correlates of the implicit association between the self and death compared to the self and life as objective markers of suicide risk. Healthy volunteers (HVs; n=21) completed a modified version of the Suicide Implicit Association Task (S-IAT) during MEG scanning. Gamma power-which is considered a proxy measure of excitation-inhibition balance-was directly compared in the self-death/self-life contrast. As a proof-of-concept, the ability of dynamic causal modeling to categorize HVs versus four individuals with recent suicide crisis (SC) was evaluated. In HVs, enhanced gamma power in both amygdala and anterior insula were found for the self-death compared with self-life contrast. In addition, connectivity estimates between early visual cortex, anterior insula, and amygdala correctly categorized SC participants with 77% to 82% sensitivity and 80% to 85% specificity. These findings, which implicate network-level changes in salience network and amygdala connectivity in mediating suicidal associations, require further replication in larger samples. 3. Randomized Controlled Trial of Riluzole Augmentation for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: Efficacy of a Glutamatergic Modulator for Antidepressant-Resistant Symptoms.Current pharmacologic treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have shown limited efficacy. The current study investigated the efficacy of glutamate modulation with riluzole augmentation for combat-related PTSD symptoms resistant to treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel trial was conducted at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and Syracuse VA Medical Center. Veterans and active duty service members with combat-related PTSD who were not responsive to SSRI or SNRI pharmacotherapy were randomized to 8-week augmentation with a starting dose of 100 mg/d of riluzole (n = 36) or placebo (n = 38) and assessed weekly for PTSD symptoms, anxiety, depression, disability, and side effects. There was clinically significant within-group improvement in overall PTSD symptoms in both groups, with a greater mean decrease in scores in the riluzole group than in the placebo group. Exploratory analyses of PTSD symptom clusters showed significantly greater improvement on hyperarousal symptoms in the riluzole group. Riluzole augmentation was not superior to placebo on change in depression, anxiety, or disability severity. Additional investigation of the mechanism of the efficacy of riluzole for hyperarousal symptoms is warranted.","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

In day-to-day life, we frequently make choices among options, and those choices lead to outcomes. Learning from experience is the process of learning how to make choices that lead to positive outcomes and to avoid choices that lead to negative outcomes. The same brain systems that are important for learning to make good choices also underlie learning when experiences happen in the absence of choices. For example, various types of trauma can lead to feelings of anxiety associated with the context in which the trauma occurred. Pathology in these systems can lead to several mental health disorders including anxiety, depression and addiction. Anxiety, along with these other disorders, represents a major public health burden with the lifetime prevalence of any anxiety disorder over 30% in the US, leading to costs to society of approximately $42 billion in the 1990s (CDC).A set of interconnected brain areas (where a set of interconnected areas is often referred to as a neural system) work collectively during learning. The neural systems that underlie learning include the amygdala, ventral-striatum, prefrontal cortical areas and the dopamine system. A major goal of our lab is to understand how each of these areas contribute to learning, and how they work together as a system. Current models of learning assume that dopamine codes a reward prediction error. The reward prediction error is the difference between a predicted reward, and the reward one receives, following a choice. Reward prediction errors can arise from rewards that are larger (a positive reward prediction error) or smaller (a negative reward prediction error) than predicted. They can also arise from punishments that are smaller than predicted (a positive reward prediction error) or larger than predicted (a negative reward prediction error). The reward prediction error coded by dopamine neurons is broadcast to much of the brain. However, current models assume that it is most specifically the ventral-striatum that receives the reward prediction error signal and uses that signal to learn the values of choices. Dopamine can be thought of as the teacher (i.e. the outcome was better or worse than expected), and the ventral-striatum as the student (i.e. what did I think the outcome was going to be and how do I learn from the prediction error). Our recent work has built on this basic idea by showing that the amygdala plays a more important role in these learning processes than previously thought. We have further begun to examine learning from negative outcomes, and found that the ventral-striatum, thought to be important for learning from gains and losses, is only important for learning from gains.","Our lab uses a combination of neurophysiology, pharmacology and imaging to understand how a set of brain areas composed of the amygdala, striatum, prefrontal cortex and dopamine underlie learning. We specifically study the process of learning to predict whether choices will lead to good or bad outcomes. We work closely with clinical collaborators, implementing tasks in animals that have shown differences between patients and controls, and taking findings from the animal work to help understand clinical populations. As we develop a better understanding of how these brain systems support learning, we can develop a better understanding of how pathology in these systems can underlie various psychiatric disorders including anxiety, depression and addiction. Our recent work has focused on broadening our understanding of the network of areas important for these learning processes. Current conceptions of the circuitry that underlies this learning focuses on dopamine and the ventral-striatum, whereas our recent work also points to an important role for the amygdala. Ongoing work examines whether different neural systems underlie learning from positive vs. negative outcomes (rewards vs. punishments), whether overlapping or distinct neural systems underlie learning actions that are beneficial vs. learning to choose objects that are beneficial. We have also recently studied increasingly sophisticated learning mechanisms and found that prefrontal cortex represents learning processes that take advantage of contextual regularities in the environment. We developed computational models that predict how neural activity changes over time in prefrontal cortex and the striatum when we learn to associate actions with rewards.","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

Adolescence is accompanied by both a surge in the incidence of affective and anxiety disorders as well as the emergence of sex differences in the prevalence of these conditions. Puberty and the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis (i.e., gonadarche) are implicated in these phenomena. Both the 2013 Global Burden of Disease report and the Lancet commission on adolescent health identified the impact of puberty and adolescence as previous blindspots in our understanding of the developmental trajectories of disease, and depressive disorders are ranked within the top four causes of disability in adolescents worldwide. Our study in normally developing children will enable the identification of physiologically relevant events related to puberty (beyond Tanner stage and simple hormone levels) and will more precisely define those reproductive events that contribute to brain development. The results of these studies will not only inform future studies in children at risk but will focus our efforts to define those physiologic events and contextual factors that could contribute to the creation of an underlying behavioral sensitivity to reproductive steroids during this critical developmental window. We intend to develop a map that more precisely defines the physiologic markers of puberty beyond those typically employed (e.g., Tanner stage) relevant to brain development. A particular strength of this study is the thorough characterization of brain development prior to gonadarche, which permits a clearer evaluation of the effects of the HPG axis activation on brain function after gonadarche within individual boys and girls who are then followed longitudinally.  This study is designed to examine several fundamental questions about the relationship between puberty and brain development, the goals of which are to 1) identify the role of gonadarche on brain development in normal boys and girls, 2) investigate sex differences in brain developmental trajectories and characterize those factors that contribute to the emergence of sex differences, 3) distinguish those pubertal events most relevant to brain development across multiple measures of brain structure and function, 4) examine the effects of sex steroids on brain systems/networks implicated in psychiatric illnesses, particularly those that are sexually dimorphic and 5) serve as an archival sample to answer questions about the impact on neurodevelopmental trajectories linked to pubertal maturation of several factors the impact of which were controlled for in this study, including the following: environmental factors (e.g., early life stress), or other identified substrates of risk for psychiatric illnesses including family history of psychiatric illness, altered timing of puberty (e.g., precocious or delayed puberty), abnormally high or low BMI, or the presence of developmental disorders.","This report includes work arising from the following clinical protocol: NCT01434368.A prepubertal cohort enters the study at age 8, and trained clinicians determine that each child meets Pubertal stage (PS) 1 criteria (i.e., no evidence of secondary sexual characteristics in breast, testes, or pubic hair), is medically well, is between the 15th and 85th percentile BMI, and has radiologic evidence of age-appropriate bone development. The absence of psychiatric illness in each child is confirmed (at each visit) by structured interview (i.e., K-SADS), and we confirm the absence of Axis I psychiatric illness in any first-degree relatives. A second cohort enters the study at 12-13 years (PS 2-3) and meets the same selection criteria as those in the prepubertal cohort. Behavioral measures include ratings of mood, social experiences within family and amongst peers, sleep, as well as measures of early life trauma. Reproductive endocrine (i.e., gonadal and adrenal steroids measured by LC-MS/MS), bone age (a reflection of cumulative tissue exposure to estradiol in both boys and girls), metabolic (i.e., MRI and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry DEXA measures of visceral fat and body composition), and physical measures (i.e., anthropomorphic indices, MRI measures of gonadal volume) are employed to fully characterize the stages, duration and tempo of pubertal development. Brain outcome measures derived via multimodal neuroimaging techniques include the following: resting-state fMRI, structural MRI, DTI, and four fMRI tasks (i.e., emotional processing, reward, impulse inhibition and working memory). These latter fMRI tasks were selected because they target neural systems reported to undergo both structural and functional transformation during adolescence and are relevant for neuropsychiatric disorders. Finally, all participants provide blood samples for genotyping, methylome measures and for the formation of cell-lines (LCLs, h-IPCs) in which functional genomics studies could be performed investigating the effects of puberty-related endocrine events on the transcriptome. To date we have studied 93 prepubertal children who were clearly identified as pre-gonadarchal by clinician-performed pubertal staging (PS) and bone age at study entry. These children have been studied longitudinally across several pubertal stages and other key developmental milestones. Given the variability in the timing of these milestones within individual children, we have retrospectively identified the onset of each milestone and we will analyze the neuroimaging data prior to and after these events. These milestones include several physiologically important events that occur during puberty/adolescence and could impact brain development as follows: first, the onset of gonadarche, which can be defined by the transition from PS1 to PS2 or the inflection point for the expansion of MRI-measured testicular and ovarian volumes (a sentinel event indicating the initial activation of the GnRH pulse generator and gonadotropin secretion at the beginning of gonadarche) or more specific markers as they emerge in the literature (e.g., declining plasma levels of makorin); second, adrenarche, which can be defined by the transition from PS1 to PS2 pubic hair or biochemically by an initial rise in circulating adrenal androgens (i.e., plasma levels of DHEA sulfate (DHEAS) > 40g/dL); third, menarche in girls defined by the first episode of menstrual bleeding and later accompanied by cyclic ovarian steroid secretion and ovulatory cycles in some but not all girls; and fourth, the growth spurt, which can be defined by the maximum velocity of growth achieved for each child or biochemically by peak secretion of collagen X bone marker (CXM) in plasma. In addition to investigating the neuroimaging data prior to and after these milestone events, we will test selected hypotheses emerging from the literature about the potential interaction of sex steroid exposure during puberty and genetic variation (e.g., BDNF, SLC6A4, GSK3, MAOA) on the developmental trajectory of brain outcomes and behaviors. Finally, using blood samples obtained in our pre-pubertal cohort at each longitudinal visit, we will examine the methylome as children transition across puberty. A particular strength of this study is the characterization of brain development pre-gonadarche, permitting a clearer evaluation of the effects of HPG axis activation on brain function within individual boys and girls who are followed longitudinally. We will implement a two-pronged analytical approach including both hypothesis-driven and data-driven analyses. For each of our endocrine and neuroimaging outcome measures, events or trajectories will be analyzed both independently and in an integrated manner (e.g., using principal component analysis) depending on the specific questions being investigated. Our hypothesis-driven approaches will be based on the extant literature and will include assessments of the impact of both discrete milestone attainment (as described above) and longitudinal trajectories of endocrine/metabolic measures on our neuroimaging modalities. Finally, our data-driven approaches will include techniques such as machine learning, multivariate statistical modelling, latent growth modelling, and methods of dimensional reduction to explore linked patterns of covariation between brain development and the physiologic events of puberty.Ultimately, in addition to testing the relevance of specific puberty-related milestones on brain development, these data also will serve as an important archival data set for studies of children at high risk for the development of several behavioral disorders.",There were no publications during this reporting period,,,

The drive for sleep is such that short periods of sleep deprivation result in rebound sleep. In animals, prolonged (2-3 weeks) sleep deprivation is fatal. Sleep is required for normal psychological, hormonal, and executive function. Humans deprived of sleep may suffer psychotic episodes, and disorders of sleep are a prominent component of many psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders including autism. One hypothesized role for sleep is for restoration of brain structural elements. Based on the premise that restoration of brain structural elements requires protein synthesis, we hypothesized that regional rates of cerebral protein synthesis (rCPS) are increased during sleep.It is widely recognized that inhibition of protein synthesis prevents memory consolidation. It has also been shown that improvements on memory tasks are sleep-dependent. The second goal of this study was to test, in humans, this hypothesized role for sleep. We measured rCPS during sleep-dependent memory consolidation. The goal was to determine directly the relationship between protein synthesis and sleep-dependent memory consolidation. This work was conducted under protocol 09-M-0123, NCT00884702.","During the FY 2021 funding period, we addressed the following:In collaboration with our colleagues from the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (T Balkin) and NINDS (D. Picchioni), we applied the L-1-C-11leucine positron emission tomography (PET) method to measure rCPS in humans during sleep. To address the restoration hypothesis of sleep, we measured rCPS in the same participant during sleep-sated wakefulness, sleep-deprived wakefulness, and sleep. We hypothesized that rCPS are increased during sleep, but that during sleep-deprived wakefulness, rCPS remain at levels comparable to sleep-sated wakefulness. Participants underwent the initial scan in the awake, sleep-sated state. Participants were then kept awake over the next 30 h and subsequently underwent a second PET scan in the sleep-deprived but awake state. Participants were then encouraged to sleep in the scanner while they underwent a third scan during slow wave sleep. Participants were healthy male and female volunteers between the ages of 18 and 28 y. We excluded participants with a history of neurological and psychiatric disorders, chronic medical conditions, and sleep disorders.  We have analyzed rCPS for all scans from 15 subjects.  Comparisons of mean rCPS among the three scans (sleep-sated awake, sleep-deprived awake, and sleep) indicate no differences among them.  We have also considered that during the sleep scan, subjects spent some time awake, some time in REM sleep and most of the time in nonREM sleep divided between slow wave and non-slow wave stages.  We estimated rCPS in slow wave and non-slow wave stages by a linear fit of measured rCPS values in the sleep-deprived awake and sleep scans and percent time spent in each sleep stage.  Our preliminary estimates indicate increases in rCPS during slow wave sleep in some brain regions.",There were no publications during this reporting period,,,

We use a multimodal approach involving genetic testing, neuropsychological testing, structural and functional MRI (fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), positron emission tomography (PET), and quantitative measures of magnetic relaxation parameters of brain tissue. The premise for this work is that the discovery and biological validation of susceptibility genes and biomarkers for psychiatric disorders will provide traction for the identification of discrete pathophysiological mechanisms and the development of new therapies. We have four primary objectives in this field. First, we aim to identify the behavioral, neural, and molecular abnormalities in psychosis that can be linked to genetic predisposition. This objective is carried forward by employing cognitive and other behavioral and clinical measurements and in vivo neuroimaging to identify brain and behavior phenotypes that are not only present in people with psychosis, but also in their unaffected siblings, who share half of their genetic material (trait liability) but do not have psychosis and do not require treatment with psychotropic medication (state effects). Second, we aim to identify facets of the molecular biology of schizophrenia risk (e.g., risk genotypes, polygenic scores, classes of genes, RNA and protein expression) that are associated with the phenotypes mentioned above, even in healthy individuals, thus, providing support for genetic effects on pertinent brain biology. Third, we aim to determine whether aspects of genetic risk predict variability in important clinical characteristics, such as illness heterogeneity and severity, functional impairment, and treatment response. Finally, we aim to identify developmental and environmental variables that interact with genetic risk in psychosis and associated biological mechanisms. Toward these ends, over more than a decade of work, we have established one of the largest databases of healthy volunteers, people with schizophrenia, and their unaffected siblings who have been characterized with a broad array of genetic, cognitive, behavioral, and neuroimaging measures.This work involves the following studies: NCT00942981, NCT00001258, NCT00024622, NCT00004571, NCT00001486.","In order to better understand how the genetic risk for schizophrenia operates at the cognitive, behavioral and neural systems level, our recent work under this project has focused on understanding the biological correlates of both polygenic illness risk and gene-by-environment interactions. Ongoing studies in these areas permit better understanding of heritable, trait-related abnormalities in schizophrenia, of the underlying molecular biology responsible for such abnormalities, and of strategies for resolving some of the illness heterogeneity that makes biological research so challenging.Schizophrenia is highly heritable but, like other psychiatric disorders, its genetic architecture is quite complex. The field has identified numerous genetic markers that are statistically associated with illness in large case-control genome-wide association studies but whose contributions to schizophrenia risk biology remain unelucidated. Considerable additional work is needed to translate these findings into a better understanding of the molecular pathways leading to system-level dysfunction in schizophrenia. This is exemplified by one of the first genes reaching genome-wide association level significance, ZNF804a, which has continued to be an important locus of schizophrenia risk, but it remains unknown how variation in this gene might confer schizophrenia risk.  Following preclinical support for ZNF804a-mediated dopamine receptor regulation, we have employed dopamine receptor PET imaging in a large cohort of healthy volunteers genotyped for the ZNF804a risk locus and identified significant and specific associations between genotype and D2 dopamine receptor availability in the striatum, providing novel evidence that this gene has implications for the dopamine system in the living human brain (Hegarty et al., 2021).  These results provide a steppingstone to further elucidation of risk mechanisms in schizophrenia and complements previous work we have performed concerning other risk loci.  This includes work in which we have employed a translational approach to better understand our previous findings of disrupted frontotemporal circuit disruptions in schizophrenia, identifying altered hippocampal-prefrontal coupling during n-back working memory performance in carriers of genetic variants that affect KCNH2-3.1 expression (Ren et al., 2020).Our most current work employs various strategies beyond single-gene effects, including the use of polygenic scores. These scores, which summarize genetic associations across the genome with a given disorder or trait, are an emerging tool for investigations of broad genetic influences on illness and behavior.  In recent work, for instance, we have shown that in schizophrenia, individuals with a cognitive profile consistent with adolescent cognitive decline harbor more severe psychotic symptomatology and greater polygenic risk burden for both schizophrenia and diminished general cognition (Dickinson et al., 2020). In conjunction with genetic factors underlying risk for schizophrenia, environmental influences have been identified as illness risk factors in epidemiological and twin studies, and delineating gene-environment interactions is likely crucial to better understanding the causes of schizophrenia. Recent research has highlighted two environmental variables that show association with schizophrenia: urbanicity and early life complications. For instance, we have demonstrated that whether an individual was raised in an urban environment significantly modifies effects of dopamine-related genes on how the prefrontal cortex responds to working memory demands. We have further replicated this finding in two additional datasets and posit that urban upbringing may alter brain function in a way that meaningfully intersects with dopaminergic neurogenetic mechanisms. Other work suggests that the predictive strength of most strongly associated loci from the recent schizophrenia genome-wide association study is greatly amplified when there is a history of clinically significant obstetrical complications. These data suggest that traditional univariate approaches must be buttressed by gene-by-environment experimentation to more fully elaborate genetic risk architecture in schizophrenia.","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

These carrier proteins catalyze the inward movement of neurotransmitter molecules and have a profound impact on the extent of receptor activation that occurs during neurotransmission. We have also shown that these transporters can possess a substrate-dependent ion channel-like activity, a property that allows them to regulate neuronal excitability and serve as sensors of extracellular neurotransmitter concentrations. Drugs which act on plasma membrane neurotransmitter transport systems are among the most widely-used treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depression and attention-deficit disorders. The high incidence of ADHD and the increasing use of medications in children provide a compelling rationale for understanding the mechanism of action of drugs used to treat these disorders. Our work on the intracellular actions of amphetamines has addressed a number of key features of amphetamine action. It has defined the trace amine receptor, TAAR1, as an intracellular receptor for AMPHs within dopamine neurons and has established that it signals through two distinct G-protein pathways. These presynaptic signaling events illustrate that amphetamines can have direct effects on signaling pathways that regulate cellular physiology, homeostasis and gene expression within dopamine neurons. Although amphetamine is viewed as a generally safe drug for the treatment of ADHD, these recent findings argue strongly for learning more about the direct effects of this class of drugs on dopamine (DA) signaling.","Our laboratory has shown that amphetamines trigger the internalization of the dopamine transporter (DAT) by a series of intracellular events that are distinct from the generally established actions of amphetamines to inhibit DA uptake or to increase DA efflux. We have found that when applied to cell lines, cultured DA neurons or midbrain slices, amphetamine activates the small GTPases, RhoA and Rac-1 and triggers internalization of the dopamine transporter (DAT) by a specialized internalization pathway that requires the activation of the small GTPase, RhoA. We also found that amphetamine must be transported into the cell to have these effects and its actions are blocked by cocaine, a drug that blocks DAT and prevents amphetamine entry. Elevation of cAMP, by DA receptors or by amphetamine-induced adenylate cyclase activation, inactivates RhoA and limits carrier internalization, consistent with roles for PKA- and Rho-dependent signaling in mediating the actions of amphetamines in dopamine neurons.Our work continues to explore our previous finding that a G-protein coupled trace amine receptor (TAAR1) serves as a direct intracellular target for amphetamines in dopaminergic, serotoninergic and noradrenergic neurons. Using transgenic mouse lines lacking the TAAR1 receptor we have shown that the intracellular effects of amphetamine, including both the elevation in cAMP and the increased RhoA activity, depend absolutely upon TAAR1 activation. We have shown that when activated by amphetamine within the cell, TAAR1 signals through a G-protein, known as G13 to activate RhoA and through another G-protein, Gs to increase cAMP. Using a series of subcellularly-targeted genetic sensors to detect RhoA or cAMP activation, we have been able to demonstrate that TAAR1 signaling initiates in an intracellular membrane compartment that is within or very proximal to the endoplasmic reticulum.We have also observed that the same amphetamine-activated RhoA-dependent mechanism downregulates a glutamate transporter, EAAT3, present on the surface of dopamine neurons. Using a cell-permeant peptide that blocks EAAT3, but not DAT internalization we have been able to resolve the effects of amphetamine on excitatory neurotransmission in brain slices and in vivo, using targeted viral expression. Surprisingly, these and additional studies that selectively delete the EAAT3 gene in dopamine neurons suggest that amphetamines effects on glutamate transporter trafficking determine the degree of locomotor activation observed following administration of the drug. We have also compared the effects of various amphetamine compounds on the activation of cellular signaling pathways. Comparison of the effects of methamphetamine on glutamate transport activity to those of amphetamine indicate that while both treatments lead to a loss of cell-surface EAAT3, the effects of methamphetamine are much broader and do not depend on the expression of the DAT. These findings provide an explanation for the broader, more detrimental effects of methamphetamine: unlike amphetamine, methamphetamine has the capacity to alter EAAT3 surface expression and regulate excitatory neurotransmission, not only in dopamine neurons, but also in many other neuronal cell types within the brain. Our recent work has shown that amphetamine has similar actions on neurotransmission by norepinephrine by activating a trace amine receptor in norepinephrine neurons, and we have established that another amphetamine-related compound, MDMA, enters serotonin neurons through the 5-HT transporter (SERT) and activates similar G-protein coupled signaling cascades in serotonergic neurons.","Ordered by reference within the summary, then by publication type and author name.

Together with our collaborators, we work towards this goal in two mutually-informative ways.First, we use large-scale longitudinal neuroimaging datasets to study the architecture of brain development in healthy volunteers. By modeling how neuroimaging measures of the human brain vary with age, sex and behavior in health, we hope to advance basic developmental neuroscience while also providing a data-driven way of selecting neuroimaging measures that should be prioritized for study in atypically developing groups.Second, we use a genetics-first strategy to study the relationship between atypical brain development and neuropsychiatric symptoms. This effort involves gathering deep-phenotypic data (spanning measures of gene expression, brain structure/function, psychophysiology, cognition and behavior) in diverse genetic disorders which all increase risk for neuropsychiatric impairment. Guided by knowledge of typical development, we harness these clinical data to empirically dissect the diverse biological pathways that can contribute to the emergence of neuropsychiatric syndromes.Cross-cutting themes of special interest within our Unit include sex-differences, allometry, and structure-function relationships within the central nervous system.","This work is conducted under protocol 89-M-0006 (NCT00001246), and falls into two broad research themes:Theme 1: Studies of behavior and brain organization in typically-developing groupsWork in this theme uses large-scale neuroimaging studies in health to advance our basic understanding of human brain organization, and guide the selection and application of imaging phenotypes for disease studies. We have so far emphasized structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) because it offers intermediate in vivo phenotypes that can be reliably measured at scale, and are highly heritable, developmentally dynamic, sensitive to disease states, and amenable to translational study in mice.During the last year, we have published work in three main areas. First, we have used brain scans from groups of related individuals to better understand genetic control of brain development and how these influences overlap with genetic determinants of cognitive ability. Second, in a large sample of typically-developing individuals, we have identified reproducible patterns of sex-biased brain anatomy and identified gene sets, cell types and cognitive domains that these sex-biases might most closely relate to. Third, we have used large neuroimaging datasets to mine correlations between different measures of brain anatomy for insights into how brain proportions vary as a function of brain size, age, the in utero environment and cognition.Theme 2: Deep phenotypic studies of participants with sex chromosome aneuploidy syndromes (SCAs)Work in this theme seeks to understand brain and behavioral changes in individuals with genetically defined neurodevelopmental disorders focusing on sex chromosome aneuploidy syndromes (SCAs) in particular. Collectively, these studies are designed to expand on past work in SCA by gathering more comprehensive measures of brain structure and function, as well as providing more fine-grained information regarding the cognitive and behavioral variations that can be seen in SCA. These data will ultimately help to better define the developmental risks and resiliencies associated with X- and Y-chromosome dosage variation in humans, and identify neurobiological systems that might underpin these associations. We hope these insights will (i) improve accurate public and professional awareness of SCAs, (ii) help clinicians provide more targeted assessment and counseling to patients and families with SCA, and (iii) begin to identify biological markers with the potential to ultimately improve assessment, prediction and treatment of neurodevelopmental issues in SCA. More broadly, this work in the specific case of SCA will shed light on (i) the principles that organize genetic influences on brain and behavior in the context of neuropsychiatric impairment, and (ii) genetic contributions to sex-differences in the brain, which are relevant for understanding the well-documented male-bias in risk for neurodevelopmental disorders more generally.During the last year, we have published work in two main areas. First, we have detailed how SCA can impact structural and functional connectivity in the human brain. Secondly, we have harnessed family-based measures of behavior and cognition to try and better-predict how severely a given SCA carrier is likely to be impacted.","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

This is achieved in part by the nervous systems ability to coordinate behavioral actions in response to internal physiological states and changing environmental conditions. In nature, this typically requires integrating sensory information, balancing competition between motivational states, and relying on predictions based on prior experience. However, while traditional models of the mammalian brain attribute this complex task to interactions between the mesocorticolimbic system and homeostatic centers of the hypothalamus, the precise nodes of integration have remained elusive. We and others have recently suggested that the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) is an attractive candidate for integrating information about internal state with associative memory and emotional signals to guide adaptive behaviors. Yet, surprisingly, this region of the brain has historically received little attention.By investigating the functional organization of the neuronal circuits of the PVT , the research conducted at the Unit on the Neurobiology of Affective Memory seeks to provide fundamental insight into the neural mechanisms that underlie flexible and adaptive behaviors. Given that deficits in processes that underlie adaptive responding are thought to give rise to psychopathology, this research may allow the identification of potential therapeutic targets for hard-to-treat mental disorders. To achieve our goals, we combine a multidisciplinary approach that includes mouse genetics, electrophysiology, neuroimaging and behavior, to conduct both in vitro and in vivo analyses of the neuronal circuits of the PVT.","Over the course of FY21, we concluded and published two independent research studies that collectively highlighted a previously neglected role for the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) in driving goal-directed behaviors. The first study showed that the PVT is part of a brain circuit that promotes food seeking behavior in response to chemically induced hypoglycemia (Beas et al., 2020). Specifically, this study implicated PVT projections to the nucleus accumbens (NAc)a ventral-striatal region previously linked to goal-directed behaviorsin food seeking behavior. Notably, our findings highlighted the PVT as a critical node in the control of glucose homeostasis and answered long-standing questions regarding the neural mechanisms that underlie this process. In the second study we discovered that, in addition to guiding appetitive goal-directed behavior, PVT projections to the NAc also control active avoidance, a goal-directed instrumental defensive response (Ma et al, 2021). Moreover, this study demonstrated a role for the PVT in mediating the selection of opposing defensive strategies. Collectively, by highlighting important contribution of the PVT to both appetitive and defensive instrumental behaviors, the studies we conducted and published during FY21 support recent proposals that the PVT is a candidate region for guiding behavioral decisions amid motivational conflicts (e.g., approach-avoidance). Elucidating the mechanisms that contribute to this behavior selection process is at the center of our ongoing research efforts. Our overarching goal is to achieve a comprehensive understanding of how the neuronal circuits of the PVT contribute to adaptive behavior. We believe that developing such framework will allow us to identify potential links between genetic and/or environmentally driven modifications of these circuits and the emergence of maladaptive behavioral states.","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

Much of our work pertains to the expression of high-level aspects of cognition, often referred to as ""executive function,"" that in some sense make us most human. It is also these aspects that are most commonly affected in neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders, and typically persist long after acute symptoms subside, and severely compromise their psychosocial function and quality of life. Patients with deficits in executive function show a heterogeneous pattern of cognitive symptoms including inattention, impaired memory, poor decision-making, perseveration, impulsivity and social disinhibition. Ultimately, understanding these deficits hinges upon embracing the details of a complex brain circuitry, and specifically the interaction between several key structures in the forebrain that govern executive function and emotion regulation.Understanding the brain mechanisms underlying the control of executive and social behavior is of great value for both basic research and medicine. In the Section of Behavioral Neuroscience, our overarching goal is to elucidate the network of forebrain and midbrain structures that steer complex executive and socioemotional behavior in the intact brain, and the disruption of which commonly leads to cognitive ailments following brain disease and injury.","Work in my lab and that of other investigators has revealed that so-called prefrontal function involves a broad network of areas including not only the prefrontal cortex but also the hippocampus, basal ganglia, and certain thalamic nuclei. These structures are anatomically connected in a particular way that is shared by rodents, humans, and non-human primates, suggesting a mammalian network underlying the forebrain control of behavior. Its relation to the regulation of neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, makes it central not only to understanding executive function, but also to schizophrenia and other disorders in humans.  As this circuitry is central to our understanding of a wide range of human cognitive abilities and disorders, our future research will continue to investigate its underlying neurobiology, always retaining as its focal point the measurement and quantification of behavior.One major theme of our research focuses on the complex interplay of frontal and temporal lobe structures in cognition and emotion. Our previous and ongoing work has shown that frontotemporal circuitry is critical for adaptive behavioral control and emotion regulation. We have thus far focused on the role of long-range connections in this network, combining behavior, inactivation, neuropharmacology, and neuroanatomical tracing. A powerful method for understanding this large-scale circuitry of frontotemporal organization, has been the use of polysynaptic anatomical tracers to delineate circuits or pathways of connected neurons. A few years ago, we showed that different regions of the hippocampus receive input from different thalamic nuclei, which in turn receive input from different cortical structures. This finding raised the question as to whether the midline thalamus is an important hub in frontotemporal circuitry, and by extension, to what extent is it a critical contributor to executive function? To get a better understanding of the organization of the prefrontal-thalamic-hippocampal interconnections, we first traced the connections of different midline thalamic nuclei. This work identified a topographical arrangement of cortical connections of the dorsal and ventral midline thalamic structures suggesting that the so-called non-specific midline thalamus is very specific in how it interacts with different cortical regions. Second, we identified, for the first time, a disynaptic input from the anterior portion of the dorsal hippocampus to the dorsal and ventral regions of the prefrontal cortex. Here we discovered three interconnected parallel circuits between the dorsal hippocampus and prefrontal cortex with connecting links in the ventral hippocampus, the lateral septum, and midline thalamus. We were particularly attentive to sex differences as we found that septal lesions caused major disturbances in the neural organization and arborization of prefrontal and hippocampal structures, which differed substantially between male and female rats. There were also differences in the way these animals responded defensively when subjected to anxiety provoking situations. Moreover, the sexual dimorphic behavioral changes in anxiety were accompanied by differences in the quality and quantity of ultrasonic vocalizations providing the first evidence to date that prefrontal-septal-hippocampal interconnections differentially influence the expression of anxiety in males and females. In the coming years, we will investigate more closely the interaction between the septum, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, as well as their neuromodulation by acetylcholine, in certain types of decision-making behavior. Drawing from our toolbox of ablation, pharmacological blockade, and cell-type specific suppression or stimulation using genetically encoded agents, we will attempt to understand the specific types of decisions served by different septal pathways.Recently, we discovered that some types of decisions, particularly those involving time, critically and specifically rely on an intact ventral hippocampus. For such decisions, the prefrontal cortex alone, appears to play a relatively minor role. At the same time, the hippocampus works together with the prefrontal cortex in other categories of decision, such as those requiring the inhibition of a prepotent response. Neurotransmitter and neuropeptide levels are known to selectively modulate the nature of this hippocampal contribution. For example, we were able to improve decision-making skills in control rats by pharmacologically stimulating the alpha-2a-receptors directly in the ventral hippocampus, whereas stimulating dopamine D1 receptors had no such effect. This modulation of cognitive decision-making may be related to the successful use of noradrenergic stimulants to relieve symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, where the site of action is presumed to be in the prefrontal cortex but never the hippocampus.In the past year, we made two additional discoveries on the role of noradrenaline in cognitive function. First, we discovered an alpha 2-adrenergic mechanism in stress induced decision-making. Specifically, we found that stress, which is associated with significant increases in noradrenaline in the hippocampus, promotes safe decision-making. If, however, we acutely activate the alpha-2a-receptors during a stressful episode, the option to choose risky behaviors is substantially increased. In the coming year we will further explore this mechanism by combining receptor specific pharmacology and optogenetic methods to elucidate the specific pathway that potentially worsens or trigger risky behaviors observed in both clinical and non-clinical populations.  Our second discovery focuses specifically on neuropeptides like galanin which are co-released with noradrenaline. Galanin receptors are highly expressed in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus. Thus, galanin released into these structures may participate in cognitive-control mechanisms that require hippocampal-prefrontal cortical circuitry. This hypothesis was supported by our recent discovery that Galanin receptor 1 mediated neurotransmission in these areas modulate impulse control mechanisms (Messanvi et al., Psychopharm, 2020). In the past year, we have targeted galanin receptor 1 specific cells in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex using cell-type specific inactivation. For this, we have combined behavioral testing with optogenetic methods using a cre-dependent virus under the control of a galanin receptor 1 promotor. This reversible manipulation approach has allowed us to gauge the relative contributions of the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and other related structures such as the nucleus accumbens and amygdala, to different types of cognitive decisions, with a high level of precision at both the behavioral and circuitry level. Our preliminary findings confirm that stimulation of galanin receptor 1 expressing cells modulate the degree of impulsivity in both prefrontal and hippocampus brain regions. The next step is to confirm the contribution of the specific pathway from the brainstem to the prefrontal and hippocampal areas to impulse control and establish the molecular signature of these interacting regions through calcium signaling.  Understanding this interplay, as well as the effects of pharmacological agents in normalizing the contribution of these circuits, is a critical component of our research agenda that can have a direct clinical impact.","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

The specific aims of our population-based research are to: 1) identify the prevalence, risk factors, symptom patterns, and comorbidity of the spectrum of mood disorders in adults and children; 2) evaluate patterns of mental and physical comorbidity; and 3) examine continuity, course, and outcome of mood and comorbid psychiatric and physical disorders.These goals are achieved through analyses of multiple, diverse population-based data sources: 1) the Adolescent Supplement of the National Comorbidity Survey (NCS-A), the first nationally representative sample of US adolescents (10,123 participants) assessing a broad range of emotional, behavioral and substance use disorders; 2) the Cohort Study of Lausanne (CoLaus/PsyCoLaus) on Cardiovascular Diseases and Depression, a large study of the population of Lausanne, Switzerland, with longitudinal data on a large population-based sample of 3,719 adults who underwent a comprehensive somatic, mental, biochemical and genetic investigation in order to prospectively study the association between cardiovascular disease/cardiovascular risk factors and psychiatric disorders; 3) the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort Study (PNC), a large primary care sample of 10,000 youth ages 8-22 who had been seen in the Pediatrics Department; 4) the Zurich Cohort Study, a 30 year longitudinal study of 591 individuals from the canton of Zurich, Switzerland; 5) the Healthy Brain Network (HBN) Study conducted by the Child Mind Institute in New York; and 6) the National Epidemiologic Study on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), one of the largest US epidemiologic samples of adults, with 3 waves of interviews now completed. During the past year our efforts have focused primarily on the NCS-A, CoLaus/PsyCoLaus, and the HBN studies, as well as other healthcare-, family-, and clinical-based datasets.","We continue to leverage the National Comorbidity Survey (NCS-A) for its rich information on risk factors to expand the scientific knowledge base that can be used to inform prevention efforts. In collaboration with a colleague at UCSF we published a study documenting associations between various indicators of social capital and mental disorder among US adolescents (Hirota et al., 2021). We found consistent and pervasive associations between mental disorder and adolescent reports of friendship quality, family cohesion, and school bonding, while caregiver reports of community social capital were less consistent. These results are consistent with the importance of peer relationships, family environment, and school as influences on adolescents' health and functioning. We continue to work with data from the NCS-A, the National Comorbidity Survey Replication, and the National Epidemiologic Study on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), to study comorbidity of medical and mental health conditions. We found associations between headache and mental disorders among US adolescents (Hommer et al., 2020). In particular, migraine was strongly associated with the presence of mood/anxiety disorders, although it was also associated with substance use and behavior disorders, and adolescents with migraine were more likely to have multiple types of mental disorder. We also published a study investigating the links between Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), and mental health and sleep among US adults (Grover et al., 2021). We found that IBS was associated with anxiety, mood, and behavior disorders, but not with substance use disorders. Finally, we published an article investigating the contributions of childhood maltreatment and mood disorder to medical comorbidities among US adults from NESARC (Stapp et al., 2020). We found that both mood disorders and childhood maltreatment contributed to medical conditions among adults, with magnitudes similar to major risk factors such as obesity and smoking, underscoring the importance of early-life exposures in shaping health and highlight the need for trauma-informed medical care. We also collaborated on a publication using data from a community-based sample of twins and siblings in Australia that investigated the structure of symptom networks in youth with, and at high risk for, bipolar disorder (BD). We found that among those with recent-onset BD and those with greater risk of BD, the symptoms of anergia and psychomotor speed were influential in the symptom structure (Scott et al., 2021). These findings are consistent with work from our mMARCH and Family Study programs that documents the importance of behavioral activation and activity as a core domain of BD. A substantial proportion of our work this year was devoted to responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. Along with researchers at the Child Mind Institute, with whom we collaborate on publications from the Healthy Brain Network (HBN) study, as well as another Branch at NIMH, we established the CRISIS Consortium. Our first task was to develop and validate a survey to measure the mental, physical, and behavioral health impacts of the pandemic. We achieved this by creating the Coronavirus Health Impact Survey (CRISIS; www.crisissurvey.org), which has subsequently been used in numerous research studies and translated into multiple languages. We published a study documenting the reliability and validity features of the CRISIS, which demonstrated the relevance of various domains measured on the CRISIS as contributors to mood/anxiety symptoms during the pandemic (Nikolaidis et al., 2020). Subsequent to its development and validation, the CRISIS was administered to parents of youth participants in the HBN at 2 time points during the pandemic. These data will serve as a valuable scientific resource, as the HBN participants were extremely well-characterized prior to the pandemic with regard to mental health, physical/psychological development, cognitive function, physical health, sleep and activity, and other key domains. We are working on several projects that leverage this rich prior data in combination with CRISIS data to study important questions regarding the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on youth mental and behavioral health. We recently advocated for such approaches, which link data across multiple platforms and systems, to serve the mental health field by using more complex study designs and analytic techniques to predict changes in population mental health in response to events such as the COVID-19 pandemic (Atkinson et al., 2020). In this commentary, we compared the field of population mental health research with that of infectious disease epidemiology and argued that more advanced ways of approaching data and research are needed to adequately deliver mental health interventions and services to the population.Transdiagnostic samples of youth with extensive measurement across a large variety of domains, such as the HBN, are necessary to develop better early interventions and improve diagnosis and treatment of mental health conditions. We recently contributed to a publication describing the inception of a new cohort study, the Neurobiology Youth Follow-up Study, which will collect such information longitudinally among youth seeking care at an early intervention clinical service in Sydney, Australia (Nichles et al., 2021). The longitudinal design will make this study a rich and beneficial resource for numerous scientific questions relevant to our own research programs as well as others across the world.  Finally, we collaborated with colleagues at NIMH on a validation study of the ASQ suicide screening tool among pediatric inpatients (Horowitz et al, 2020). Our validation study showed that the ASQ provides effective screening of pediatric medical/surgical inpatients for suicide risk that is also feasible and acceptable. Public Health Impact:The investigation of risk factors during development, which the NCS-A makes possible, is extremely important in mental health because many cases of psychiatric disorder first arise during or prior to young adulthood and because brain development is implicated in the etiology of many psychiatric disorders. Our studies of physical-mental comorbidity and sleep in adolescents and adults complement our family study work on the importance of physiological systems and behavioral rhythms in mental health and contribute to scientific understanding of psychiatric disorder etiology and opportunities for prevention. Our work to understand the core clinical domains underlying BD complements our other research programs and will ultimately aid in treatment and prevention by informing disorder etiology. Our recently established CRISIS Consortium and continued collaboration with HBN will further our opportunity to conduct research aimed at reducing the adverse consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and other influences on mental health problems among youth, which may have life-long positive benefit. Future Plans:We plan to continue our activity in the CRISIS Consortium and the HBN study with intensive analysis of collected data on clinical features, risk factors, and impairment. We are also helping to design and implement a prospective follow-up of select HBN participants that will provide longitudinal information on patterns of symptoms, behaviors, and risk across time during development. We also expect to continue publishing population-based studies related the themes of: 1) the intersection between physical and mental health, 2) the relation between health behaviors such as sleep and activity and psychiatric disorders, 3) the influence of environmental and social exposures among children and youth; 4) associations between sleep, physical activity and mood disorders; and 5) subtypes of depression, mania and their core component","Ordered by reference within the summary, then by publication type and author name.

To comprehensively study the role of motor activity, the cross-site collaboration entitled Motor Activity Research Consortium for Health (mMARCH) was established to standardize methods and analytic approaches to investigate associations between motor activity, mood, and related disorders across studies and cultures.In collaboration with experts in analytic methods for actigraphy in the S.M.A.R.T. (Statistical Methods and Applications for Research in Technology) group in the Department of Biostatistics at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, we have established a collaborative activity network (mMARCH).  The six core mMARCH sites involved include: 1) the CoLaus/PsyCoLaus Study in Lausanne, Switzerland (Martin Preisig, MD, MPH); 2) the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) at VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam, Netherlands (Brenda Penninx, PhD; Femke Lamers, PhD); 3) the Youth Mental Health Clinic at the Brain & Mind Research Institute (BMRI) in Campbelltown, Sydney, Australia (Ian Hickie, MD); 4) the Brisbane Adolescent Twin Project in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia (Nick Martin, PhD; Margie Wright, PhD); 5) the Hong Kong Study of Bipolar I Disorder at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Jihui Zhang, MD); and 6) the NIMH Family Study of Affective and Anxiety Spectrum Disorders (NIMH Family Study) in Bethesda, MD (Kathleen Merikangas, PhD). The core group selected the GENEActiv Device (Activinsights Ltd., geneactiv.org) to measure actigraphy, and most sites also include ecological momentary assessment (EMA). The specific aims of mMARCH are to: 1) develop standard procedures for study administration, data management, and analyses of actigraphy data; 2) conduct cross-site and meta/mega analyses in order to increase power and cross validate common study questions; 3) develop and pilot collection of supplementary information using electronic or paper and pencil diary data; and 4) facilitate joint analyses of data to address topics defined by thematic subgroups (mood disorders, substance use/disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, genetic risk factors, sleep, physical health conditions, circadian rhythms, development, and inter-relationships of sleep, activity, eating, emotion, etc).","There is growing interest in studying the environmental, biologic, and genetic correlates of the components of motor activity as well as the relationships between motor activity with sleep, exercise, mood, and cognitive functioning. Aggregation of the findings across studies is challenged by the substantial differences in both the study goals, procedures, and statistical methods. Therefore, mMARCH seeks greater coordination across studies in the procedures and analytic methods of functional data associated with mood and other disorders. In the past year at NIMH, we have been expanding on intensive multimodal studies of youth and within families, following up samples to examine stability, and expanding on domains of assessment. Across the initiative, we have developed a new processing platform (GGIR, an R package to analyze accelerometer data); processed and analyzed actigraphy data from 6 sites; applied novel statistical methods including functional data analysis and Joint Individual Variance Explained (JIVE) to actigraphy cross-site data; collected and analyzed concomitant ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data from 2 sites; examined cross device features; and expanded to new sites including Yale, Toronto (CAMH), and the Healthy Brain Network, NY. Additionally, over the last year we collaborated to publish several key papers related to motor activity and daily rhythms monitoring. With researchers in Australia, we outlined evidence for a new clinical phenotype- circadian depression. We hypothesized this phenotype as cross-cutting, accounting for some cases with diagnoses currently conceptualized as depressive, bipolar disorder (BD), anxious, psychotic, and/or somatic physical syndromes such as chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia. We proposed that the key clinical features of circadian depression included disrupted 24-hour sleep wake cycles, reduced motor activity, low subjective energy, and weight gain. Further investigation is needed to evaluate the utility of the proposed phenotype and to guide the optimal use of circadian-targeted interventions (Carpenter et al, 2021). We continued to join forces with collaborators from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) to employ the processing and statistical methods that we have developed to pursue study specific hypotheses, and we published a study on the association between daily motor activity patterns assessed via actigraphy and 1) sociodemographic, health and lifestyle and sampling factors, and 2) psychiatric clinical characteristics in the NESDA site (Difrancesco et al, 2021). Results demonstrated that the presence and severity of depression/anxiety disorders were associated with a lower overall activity pattern but not with the time of activity, while age, work/school days and season were strongly associated with patterns and time of activity. It is recommended that future studies on motor activity in depression/anxiety take these patterns into account. Additionally, in a commentary related to a recent publication in Bipolar Disorders, we advocated for the inclusion of digital technologies as additional choices for the treatment and prevention of the high risk of suicide of BD (Panchal et al, 2021). Two ongoing collaborator studies of treatment of youth at risk for mood disorders (Strauss, Battaglia et al, CAMH) and suicide (Blumberg et al, Yale) are now employing the procedures that we have developed for real-time assessments of mood and related domains. We have also been involved in reviewing the aggregate evidence and establishing procedures and analytic methods for the use of combined passive (wrist-worn actigraphy) and active (EMA) mobile technologies to gain insight into the role of the circadian system and patterns of sleep and motor activity in people with BD (Dunster et al, 2020).  The strong associations across the domains tapped by real-time monitoring suggest that future research should shift focus on sleep, physical/motor activity, or circadian patterns to identify common biologic pathways that influence their interrelations.Public Health Impact:The formation and continuation of the mMARCH initiative will enable groups to efficiently share and combine data to learn more about how activity affects different disorders and diseases across many populations, including mood disorders, sleep patterns, circadian rhythms, genetic studies, emotion, eating, and other disorders that impact public health. This work will also define targets for prevention and intervention studies.Future Plans:Plans for the next year include expanding the network using the common procedures of actigraphy and EMA to include more sites that can conduct common data analyses, continued development of analytic models including multi-level dynamic models of intensive repeated measures data, and machine learning approaches that classify the structure of inter-relationships among the regulatory domains under investigation. We will also report the findings of our analyses of several projects that investigate the heritability of actigraphy phenotypes and their associations with clinical and health measures in the NIMH and CoLaus family studies, and genetic association studies of these phenotypes in the CoLaus cohort. We will focus on five major activities: 1) joint analysis of the mMARCH core group data including the CoLaus/PsyCoLaus study of comorbidity of depression and cardiovascular disease, the NESDA study in the Netherlands, the Australian studies of twin and youth with emerging mood disorders, and the Hong Kong circadian rhythms study; 2) follow-up of the NIMH Family Study and CoLaus/PsyCoLaus samples to investigate the stability of the findings from the first wave of participation; 3) addition of several sites with actigraphy data in both adults and youth with BD; 4) initiation of new studies of youth in seven sites (miniMARCH collaboration); and 5) development of translational studies to identify the regulatory systems underlying motor activity and sleep across species. We also plan to examine the cross-domain inter-relationships and their directional influences using real-time tracking and experimental paradigms in the NIH Rhythms and Blues Program.","Ordered by reference within the summary, then by publication type and author name.

Psychotherapies and psychopharmacology are often helpful, but unfortunately many patients do not respond to available therapies. New developments in engineering and technology have opened the door to a new set of interventions with which to study and treat brain-based disorders that are not effectively managed with available treatments. Collectively, these neuromodulation tools apply energy to the brain, using electrical or magnetic fields, with the goal of studying brain function and of treating depression and other disabling conditions.The Noninvasive Neuromodulation Unit (NNU) focuses on developing novel noninvasive neuromodulation tools, coupled with brain measurements via neurophysiology and neuroimaging, to measure and modulate neural plasticity for the study and treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. The NNU provides expertise in neuromodulation tools to support other NIH investigators, and we conduct research projects focused on advancing neuromodulation technologies to improve their utility and safety. Specifically, we develop novel stimulation paradigms and biomarker batteries to investigate brain-behavior relationships and to inform novel intervention development. Our team, spanning the fields of psychiatry, engineering, neuroscience and psychology, has expertise in electric field modeling, device and coil design for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), cognitive neuroscience trials employing image-guided neuromodulation, and the translational development of novel treatments in preclinical models, healthy volunteers, and clinical populations. As a service within the Multi-Modal Imaging Center directed by Dr. Bandettini, the Non-Invasive Neuromodulation service includes TMS, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), magnetic seizure therapy (MST), TMS-compatible EEG (electroencephalography), and TMS/fMRI interleaving facilities. We supply state of the art TMS, tDCS, tACS, EEG, EMG (electromyography), frameless stereotaxy (neuronavigation), perturbation/physiology equipment and associated data processing pipelines to support NIH IRP investigators. Our mission is:1. to develop novel technology and stimulation paradigms for neuromodulation, and 2. to advance understanding of mechanisms of neuromodulation therapies, including the spatial, temporal, and contextual aspects of brain stimulation","Work was conducted under clinical protocols NCT03065335, NCT03289923, NCT03895658, NCT03895658, NCT04798274, NCT03351764 and NCT02363296Our projects fall into 3 themes: 1) measuring neuroplasticity, 2) modulating neuroplasticity, 3) modeling the effects of neuromodulation and mining multi-modal datasets to discover biomarkers of rapid antidepressant response. Our projects include:Theme I: Measuring NeuroplasticityMechanisms of Rapid Antidepressant Action collaboration with Drs. Zarate and Parko This project develops biomarkers of rapid antidepressant response through the addition of TMS-EMG, TMS-EEG neuroplasticity measures to the existing intramural research program on ketamine.Concurrent fMRI-guided rTMS and cognitive therapy for the treatment of major depressive episodeso This project (which also incorporates Theme II, below) uses magnetoencephalography (MEG) (in collaboration with Allison Nugent (ETPB)), fMRI, and TMS/EEG to measure brain network engagement and neuroplastic changes due to multimodal TMS/CBT in depressed adults.Theme II: Modulating NeuroplasticityWe are taking complementary approaches to modulating neuroplasticity: 1) seizure-induced neuroplasticity, 2) paired associative stimulation (PAS) and 3) novel tool development to extend the spatial and temporal specificity of noninvasive neuromodulation.Next generation seizure therapy collaboration with Drs. Zarate, Park, Bikson, Datta - NCT03895658o Therapeutically induced seizures exert rapid antidepressant action and are robust inducers of neurotrophic factors and neurogenesis. New technologies for focal seizure induction may improve the risk/benefit ratio by lowering cognitive side effects, and also provide the valuable scientific opportunity to examine common mechanisms across rapidly acting interventions such as ketamine.o This project involves optimization of seizure therapy dosing, through the study of individualized low amplitude seizure therapy (iLAST), comprised of focal seizure induction with minimal current exposure to improve tolerability of seizure therapy for depression.Cognitive Paired Associative Stimulation (C-PAS)o PAS has been shown to strengthen synaptic efficacy within a circuit through repeated co-activation and coincident firing. We extend that approach to activate a targeted neural circuit through cognitive task performance, and couple that with simultaneous focal neuromodulation to enhance plasticity, as a means of enhancing circuit function and improving the functional-specificity of neuromodulation action. One of our projects employs fMRI-guided TMS paired with a specific form of cognitive behavioral therapy for the treatment of depression (in collaboration with Dr. Strauman, NCT03289923). Another of our projects, conducted in the form of a cooperative agreement (5U01AG050618) uses fMRI-guided TMS with simultaneous working memory training to enhance executive function in older adults (in collaboration with Drs. Appelbaum, Peterchev, and Cabeza), was successfully completed this year and resulted in the publication of eight reports in peer-reviewed journals.Role of GABAergic transmission in auditory processing in Autism Spectrum Disorder (DECIBELS) - NCT04798274This project uses MEG (in collaboration with Allison Nugent (ETPB)), fMRI to measure brain network engagement and neurochemical changes following an acute session of rTMS in healthy volunteers and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (in collaboration with Lindsay Oberman (OCD/NNU) and Audrey Thurm (OCD)).Novel Tool Development - NCT03351764TMS research has been slowed due to two fundamental problems that directly impact its usefulness. First, the space of parameters used to produce TMS is immensely large and has barely been explored. Second, the interaction of any set of TMS parameters with any individual brain is poorly understood, and this has led to unpredictable efficacy and a large amount of inter-individual variability in TMS studies. The purpose of this technical development protocol is to address these two fundamental deficiencies. Our ongoing projects within this healthy volunteer protocol include:1. Controlling ongoing cortical state during NIBS with neurofeedback.This study asks: Does controlling brain states using neurofeedback result in greater intra- and inter-individual variability in responses to TMS? The aim is to explore the use of neurofeedback to control brain state, using EEG to evaluate the cortical response to single pulses of TMS while subjects are controlling the electrophysiological state of their brain.2. Parametric studies to optimize theta-burst stimulation (TBS).While patterned stimulation such as TBS may represent a more potent form of TMS, its effects are quite unreliable between subjects. Moreover, there has not been a parametric examination of the stimulation parameters used in TBS. We have begun with the intertrain interval as the first parameter to examine, with the aim to parametrically measure its effects on TBS response.3. Noninvasive focal deep brain stimulation (nfDBS)We seek to establish whether TMS can reach, in a dose-dependent way, a targeted subcortical region transynaptically which is too distant for effective direct TMS stimulation, using TMS as a probe of the fronto-striatal network, a key circuit implicated in reward processing. This will be tested with the perturbation-imaging procedure of TMS/fMRI interleaving, i.e. while participants receive TMS during both resting state and task-based fMRI.4. Transcranial direct current stimulation to reduce effects of nicotine withdrawal syndromeNIDA Protocol 12-DA-N474 (PI: E.A.Stein, collaborators: Sarah Aronson)Symptoms of nicotine withdrawal remain a major impediment for smokers trying to quit, with most quit attempts failing within the first week of abstinence when withdrawal symptoms are at their height. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) has the potential to modify neuronal circuits by application of a subthreshold conductive current through the scalp. The goal is to investigate the effects of tDCS on modulating large-scale brain networks dysregulated in nicotine addiction and withdrawal.5. Closed-loop paired associative stimulation - NCT02363296The effects of noninvasive brain stimulation can be extremely variable across subjects. One source of this variability is known to be the state of the brain at the time of stimulation. One way of addressing this source of variability is to trigger the TMS when the brain is in an up-state or a down-state. To accomplish this, real-time signal processing is utilized to analyze the EEG and predict where the brain oscillations will be milliseconds in advance. The TMS trigger is controlled by the real-time hardware.Theme III: Modeling Neuroplasticity / Mining Multi-Modal DatasetsOur team comprises engineering expertise to perform in silico modeling of the spatial and temporal effects of neuromodulation on neuronal function, and to apply machine learning and graph theoretical approaches to data-mining and hypothesis generation to support the discovery of common mechanisms across rapidly acting antidepressant interventions.","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

Millions of neurons change their activity in response to even the smallest sensory stimulus. How does the brain use, or decode, these millions of neurons' activity to generate a behavior? It might be that our brains average over many neurons, or decode only cells with specific properties. As an example, to make a decision on whether a visual edge has a particular orientation, it might be that the brain integrates information from all the cells that respond to the edge, or only a small number of cells that are most specific to that edge. Theoretical frameworks exist that can justify either possibility.To shed light on how the brain makes behavioral decisions using neuronal activity, we use optical and electrical methods to record and perturb the activity of populations of neurons during behavior. We have developed psychophysical behavioral assays that can accurately measure small changes in perceptual behavior. These assays are well-suited to examine the small behavioral changes that arise from changes in neurons' activity. We also draw on insights from machine learning, using how decoding works in artificial networks to form hypotheses about how the brain might decode activity. The combination of these methods can allow new examinations of the circuit basis of mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, that lead to changes in perception.","Cortical neurons fire in complex patterns of activity during behavior and cognition. In sensory regions of the cortex, animals' interactions with the sensory world evoke neural activity in the cortex. But not all patterns of cortical activity can be elicited by sensory stimuli. We study how non-sensory, artificially induced activity patterns can be used by animals to make behavioral responses. These studies shed light on the limits of cortical function, and how circuit properties like neural connections constrain the set of activity patterns the cerebral cortex can process.Trained animals (Emx1-Cre) report non-sensory optogenetic stimuli delivered to excitatory cells (Flex-ChrimsonR) in primary visual cortex. We find that animals improve their detection performance for such stimuli over the course of days, exhibiting learning in both sensitivity (more accurate responses to stimuli) and speed (faster responses to stimuli). Animals show a mean decrease in reaction time per session for constant stimulus intensity (p<0.01, Wilcoxon rank sum test against median of 0). Over many days, subjects improve their detection sensitivity by several orders of magnitude in stimulus intensity.  Recent findings show that cortical responses to the optogenetic input also increase, suggesting a remodeling of recurrent connectivity that can increase amplification of the input as animals learn to use that input. The implications are broad: that cortical networks use recurrent connectivity to amplify certain patterns of input, and that this amplification can developed, via learning, in the adult. We have also examined how decisions are controlled at the level of interacting brain areas, by examining the roles of multiple brain areas in a sensory task.  Primary visual cortex (V1) in the mouse projects to numerous brain areas, including several secondary visual areas, frontal cortex, and basal ganglia. While it has been demonstrated that optogenetic silencing of V1 strongly impairs visually guided behavior, it is not known which downstream areas are required for visual behaviors. We trained mice to perform a contrast-increment change detection task, for which substantial stimulus information is present in V1. Optogenetic silencing of visual responses in secondary visual areas revealed that their activity is required for even this simple visual task. In vivo electrophysiology showed that, although inhibiting secondary visual areas could produce some feedback effects in V1, the principal effect was profound suppression at the location of the optogenetic light. The results show that pathways through secondary visual areas are necessary for even simple visual behaviors. Together with other work in the lab, these findings contribute to our understanding of how cortical networks compute  that is, how the connectivity within and between brain areas transforms inputs to process information, a function that is at the core of how brains work.","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

Rates of depression increase dramatically during adolescence: 20% of youths experience a major depressive episode before age 18 (Kessler et al., 1994; Beesdoet al., 2009), and five-year relapse rates approach 60% (Dunn & Goodyer, 2006). Longitudinal research suggests strong continuity of adolescent depression into adulthood, with persistent impairments in social and occupational functioning and markedly elevated risk of suicide attempts (Costello et al., 2002; Weissman et al., 1999). Yet, compared to many other medical conditions, we know little about the mechanisms underlying adolescent depression. In recent years, reward processing has emerged as a mechanism that could plausibly underlie several key behavioral and neural aberrations observed in depression (Treadway & Zald 2011; Whitton et al., 2015). We pursue the following broad questions: 1)	What is the concordance of measures of reward processing in depression over time?2)	How does reward processing in depression compare to other common problems of childhood, such as anxiety and irritability?3)	How does reward processing interact with systems subserving sense of agency?4)	What can treatments tell us about reward processing and can they help us improve treatment of people with depression?5) How does environmental stress impact upon reward processing? This is a new COVID-related project where we examine how stress related to the coronavirus pandemic is affecting how young people value and learn from rewards. For this purpose, we have developed an array of new methods, including a new questionnaire in collaboration with two other laboratories, that is now being used all over the world and has been translated in over 12 foreign languages.","Under NCT03388606, we have achieved the following despite the pandemic, as of August 2020:Enrollment in Characterization:45 (30 MDD; 15 HV)Enrollment in Outpatient Treatment:12 outpatients enrolled (or were continuing in treatment)Enrollment in inpatient Treatment:0 patients enrolled (or continued in treatment as a result of pandemic-related closures)As an indicator of the amount of work during the pandemic, the clinicians in my group had most of their contact with patients be virtual between since the onset of the pandemic.Also, as part of our research we have collected eight waves of data related to COVID already and have now submitted a relevant paper on the effects of the pandemic on mental health out of our sample.","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

To do so, we perturb the brain activity using electrical microstimulation, optogenetics and drug microinjections and measure the effects of perturbation on the neural activity profile as well as a battery of psychophysical tasks. The goal is to separate the neural events that causally drive visual perception and behavior from those that are epiphenomenal.","During the past year the lab has been functional at full capacity, other than limitations imposed by social distancing. We now have four functional physiology setups (including eye trackers, electrophysiology and optogenetic closed-loop control systems), all of them are actively producing data. Our projects can be divided into two main classes. One, we have named Perceptography is a novel approach to brain stimulation that includes about 75% of the lab activity. The goal of perceptography is to develop graphical representations of the state of visual perception during stimulation of various brain areas. In simple words, perceptography aims at taking pictures of the subjective state of visual perception when the brain is being locally stimulated in various high level visual areas. This is a critical step for developing effective visual prosthetics. Perceptography incorporates machine vision and adversarial artificial neural networks for developing images that are indistinguishable from the state of neural perturbation. In a closed-loop system, the artificial neural network accumulates an internal record of the behavioral choices of the animal to artificially synthesize images that appear more similar to the animal to the altered perceptual state induced by the neural perturbation. This was a dream in development last year, but now we have made significant progress in the area and we have three major projects covering various aspects of this general approach. Data collection for one of these projects in finished and we are preparing the manuscript. Out of the other two, one is still in data collection phase. The other was significantly slowed down following our lowering of space use due to COVID related social distancing rules, but we have now adapted our setup and started the process of data collection for it. The other class of projects in the lab involves measuring the effect of pharmacological neural perturbation in the face-selective parts of the inferior temporal cortex on eye movements and the behavioral pattern of visual search. We have collected the majority of data for this line of research, although data collection still continues. Given the novelty of our approach from both technical and theoretical aspects, our strategy for sharing these results with the scientific community is first to publish a methods paper describing the technical aspects of the approach, and then we will follow up with a sequence of scientific papers that include the findings of our main projects.","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

To comprehend how the neocortex integrates and contextually computes relevant incoming information, a mechanistic understanding of the recruitment and role of the various cellular and circuit elements within the corticocortical communication is imperative. This is the overarching goal of our research program.","To understand the principles of long-range connectivity in cortical communication, our efforts have focused on the following three projects during FY21.Functional connectivity of diverse long-range inputs to sensory cortex is aimed at achieving a mechanistic understanding of the functional connectivity of feedback / top-down projections to the primary sensory cortex. We have systematically examined the synaptic strength from different brain areas to diverse neuronal types in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and determined how the primary sensory cortex uses input-area-dependent, preferential recruitment of specific types of GABAergic interneurons to parse information from diverse feedback projections. Based on this framework, we investigate how cortical feedback projections to S1 are altered in a transgenic mouse line in which one of the neurodevelopmental (NDD) high risk genes is mutated in different types of GABAergic interneurons (INs). The second project, the structural organization of cortical subnetworks, is aimed at understanding the principles that govern the functional heterogeneity of principal neurons in sensory cortex. Neuronal activity in the superficial layer of the primary sensory cortex is highly heterogenous in relation to various aspects of the animal's behavior. We asked whether functionally heterogeneous subnetworks are constrained by specific long-range and local presynaptic ensembles. This study provides the circuit-based mechanism for the organization of cortical subnetworks. Using single cell-initiated, monosynaptic rabies virus tracing combined with calcium imaging, we found that behavior state-encoding (spontaneous movement) neurons show characteristic long-range and local presynaptic networks. Our results reveal connectivity rules that support functional heterogeneity of cortical principal cells. In the third project, we investigate the role of higher-order thalamic nucleus in sensory perception. Somatosensation is an active process. Active sensation is a form of goal-directed behavior and is thus inherently related to brain and behavioral states of the animal, such as intention, attention, and motivation. Despite that action and sensation are tightly integrated contingent on the animals goal during active sensation, the neuronal substrates and circuits that mediate such interaction remain poorly understood. Anatomical studies suggest that whisker-dependent sensorimotor integration takes place in multiple closed loops in the brain. Posteriomedial thalamic nucleus (POm), a higher-order thalamic nucleus, is one of the key nodes in these closed loop circuits. The mechanisms by which the POm neurons process information from multiple input sources and shape activity in downstream targets during active sensation is largely unknown. In the third project, we aim to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the neuronal circuits of the POm and its role in active sensation during natural and realistic behavioral condition. To this end, we have developed a self-initiated, two-alternative forced choice task in freely moving mice. Using this simple yet robust whisker-dependent sensory perception task, we characterize how diverse afferent inputs to POm differentially engage POm neurons in the context of motivation and active sensation. We test the hypothesis that cortical top-down, feedback inputs convey context-dependent information to POm during active sensation and thus modulate POm activity.","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

Before our discovery, the retina was thought to contain only rods and cones, the classical photoreceptors. We have been at the forefront of major discoveries in this field and will continue to define the retinal circuits and brain centers by which ipRGCs drive a variety of critical functions, which include circadian photoentrainment, sleep, mood, learning & memory and the pupillary light reflex. We have generated and will continue to generate multiple genetic mouse models; employ morphological and electrophysiological analyses; and establish quantitative behavioral assays to reveal the neural circuitry, developmental pathways, and in vivo functions of ipRGCs. These powerful complementary approaches will allow us to tackle exciting new directions on ipRGC functions in image formation, mood, learning and sleep. Collectively, our research will lead to a better understanding of how light influences our life and will inform light-based therapeutic measures to improve our well-being.The objectives of our section are fourfold: 1- Understand how the classical photoreceptors, rods and cones, interact with ipRGCs at the retinal level and how their combined light processing is signaled to the brain to influence light-dependent behaviors. 2- Define new sleep areas that are modulated by light input. 3- Understand the developmental program for retinal ganglion cells. 4-Decipher the differential input from ipRGCs and conventional RGCs to different brain regions. Combined, these objectives will afford us a better understanding of how environmental stimuli (e.g., light) interact with their cognate receptors (e.g., photoreceptors in the retina) to influence important behaviors for human health (e.g., sleep, metabolism, mood and learning).","Research projects, Fiscal Year 2021, can be divided into four major areas listed below:1- How rods and cones drive behaviors through ipRGCsWe have generated genetically modified mouse lines to uncover the contribution of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) and the corresponding brain circuits to the synchronization of the internal biological clock to the solar day. We have animals that either harbor only the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)-projecting ipRGCs (Chen et al., Nature 2011) or we used viruses to block input from non-SCN regions keeping the ipRGCs that project to the SCN intact. We found different contributions of individual subtypes of ipRGCs to circadian photoentrainment. Remarkably, the rod/cone input requires areas distinct from the SCN for photoentrainment. Specifically, Brn3b-negative ipRGCs do not support rod/cone input, whereas Brn3b-positive ipRGCs are predominantly important for rod/cone input. We are currently preparing a manuscript for publication for this important discovery.We made a startling discovery that a subpopulation of ipRGCs (200 M1-Brn3b-negative, which we called circadian photoreceptors) is critical for the development of the circadian clock as well as vision, although they do not project to visual centers (Chew et al., eLife 2017). An exciting hypothesis is that these 200 ipRGCs (Chen et al., Nature 2011) represent an evolutionarily ancient photoreceptor class given their broad influence on several distinct behaviors (photoentrainment, development of the clock and vision as well as local pupillary light reflex). Therefore, it is critical to understand the molecular and functional specification of this population in relation to other ipRGCs and conventional ganglion cells. Thus, we obtained data in collaboration with Alex Kolodkin's lab at the Johns Hopkins University-School of Medicine for the transcriptome of this population. This project will provide the molecular handles to understand the ontogeny and the functional specialization of the 200 M1 ipRGCs in relation to other ipRGCs and conventional ganglion cells.Finally, it is well established that light therapy can be used to treat several types of major depression in humans. However, it has been hard to ascertain whether these effects of light are purely placebo effects. We recently published an exciting brain region involved in mediating light effects on mood (Fernandez et. al., Cell 2018). We started collaborating with Dr. Hugo Tejeda to understand how this brain region interacts with downstream regions to influence mood. Future collaborations are established with the labs of Drs. Chudasama and Merikangas to determine if this region is found in primates, including humans. In addition, since this mood center receives predominant input from Brn3b-positive ipRGCs, we will determine whether rod/cone input to this region is important for mood regulation.2- Define new sleep areas that are modulated by light input.An unanswered question in the field of sleep is whether light required for circadian photoentrainment uses the same circuits as those required for the acute effects of light on sleep. We recently published that the SCN is dispensable for such effects (Rupp et. al., Elife 2019). We discovered that the Brn3b-negative ipRGCs that project to the SCN are sufficient for photoentraining sleep rhythms. Remarkably, these cells are not capable of inducing acute effects of light on sleep. In fact, we show that cells other than the ipRGCs that project to the SCN are required (Rupp et. al., Elife 2019). We now have a paper accepted in Nature Communications that uncovers the brain region that is required for the effects of light on sleep. This region is part of the preoptic region and projects to wakefulness centers.3- Understand the developmental program for retinal ganglion cells.A dogma in textbooks indicates that Atonal 7 (Atoh7) is the master transcription factor that specifies all RGCs in mammals. We have shown recently that the story is much more elaborate than that. In a paper we published in Science Advances, we reveal that only 50% of RGCs are truly dependent on Atoh7 for specification. Other ganglion cells require Atoh7 in a cell non-autonomous fashion for survival. 4-Decipher the differential input from ipRGCs and conventional RGCs to different brain regions.How do ipRGCs and RGCs target different brain regions to influence behavior? In a tour de force approach, we were able to label the ipRGCs and the RGCs separately and show how they target different brain regions. We discovered that in addition to the SCN, a ventral region in the visual thalamus receives exclusive input from ipRGCs. This opens a new area to try to understand the role of this region in non-image forming visual functions. Together, we will continue to break new ground about how light signaling from the environment regulates several functions that are essential for the well-being of humans.","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

Our research uses a combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging, computational modeling and analysis, and psychophysical measurements to link human perception to measurements of brain activity.","In FY21, we continued to pursue two lines of research, focusing on 1) characterizing the representation of stimulus features in primary visual cortex and 2) studying how these stimulus representations interact with feedback signals to visual cortex associated with general arousal, emotional valence, and object-selective processes. Studies were carried out under clinical protocol NCT00001360.1) Characterizing stimulus representations in human visual cortex.A central goal in the laboratory is to understand the neural computations that give rise to stimulus feature selectivity. Many of the studies in our group use the visual system as a model, and specifically study the computations that lead to orientation selectivity.  Stimulus orientation is one of the most basic stimulus features represented in primary visual cortex (V1). Yet, after more than 50 years of research, the representation of orientation is inadequately understood. It is well established that orientation-selective V1 neurons are organized at a fine spatial scale in a pseudo-periodic, columnar structure across the cortical surface. However, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we have previously discovered an additional level of organization, a coarse-scale orientation bias in which each fMRI voxel in V1 exhibits an orientation preference that depends on the region of space that it represents.In FY21, we have developed a population model of V1 that provides a computational framework for investigating orientation selectivity (Gardner and Merriam, 2021). Using the model, we have demonstrated that three theoretically distinct neural mechanisms could each contribute independently to orientation biases: stimulus vignetting, neural gain fields, and asymmetric surround suppression. This modeling result shows that these mechanisms can easily be confused with one another. For example, attempts to measure surround suppression, which is thought to be a marker for excitatory/inhibitory imbalance in cortex, and implicated in a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders, could in fact be confounded with other neural mechanisms.  Another implication of the model is that it should be possible to isolate orientation-selectivity signals arising from each of these factors. However, our modeling work suggests that the relatively low signal-to-noise ratio of fMRI may limit the ability to achieve this. We are currently analyzing a very large publicly-available dataset of fMRI responses to naturalistic visual stimuli. This large dataset, collected at high-field strength with many repeated measurements from a small group of participants, may provide insights into the relative contribution of each of these mechanisms for orientation selectivity. Our work on understanding neural computations in the intact visual system is vital in determining how computations are altered in mental health and neurological disorders.2) The role of feedback in visual processingA second theme in the laboratory is to understand the influence of non-sensory cognitive signals in visual perception. We have identified a type of brain activity that reflects a subject's general engagement in a task. This task-related activity contributes prominently to brain hemodynamic responses measured with fMRI, is independent of external visual stimuli, and instead reflects internal brain states. Task-related activity appears to be distinct from spatial attention in that it is global in cortex rather than retinotopically-specific. This activity may be related to general arousal. To test this hypothesis, we systematically varied 1) task difficulty, 2) the expected reward for correct performance, and 3) the temporal predictability of the task structure. We found that a widespread fMRI response tracks arousal level in each of these task conditions, exhibiting a significance correlation with pupil size. A manuscript on this set of studies is currently under review. Understanding the neural mechanisms of global brain states has implications for the study of a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, autism and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).We have begun to use high-resolution, high-field strength fMRI to study feedback signals in individual layers in visual cortex. We have used this cutting-edge approach to study the laminar profile of responses to faces that differ with regard to emotional valence (e.g., pictures of faces with fearful or happy expressions). We are also using this approach to study feedback signals related to object perception. These studies are currently in progress and will be a focus of the lab during the coming year.","Ordered by reference within the summary, then by publication type and author name.

A central question in neuroscience is how these inputs are summed to produce spiking outputs. For example, in primary sensory cortex, a particular sensory stimulus can evoke different numbers of spikes depending on the behavioral state of the animal, presumably reflecting one sort of summation change --- response gain variability. Theoretical work has characterized an array of input-summation processes that are potentially used by cortical networks, promising to explain generally how cortical networks respond to input. However, it has proven extremely difficult to obtain the experimental data needed to support and test this theoretical work, primarily because sensory stimuli generally affect neural activity within multiple brain regions, each of which could subsequently provide input to the area under study. Optogenetic stimulation, combined with sensory stimuli, can provide critical tests of these theoretical models.To understand how cortical neurons perform computation, we use a joint experimental and theoretical approach. We measure, in working brains, how visual cortical neurons respond to combinations of optogenetic and visual input, and we use network models to understand the circuit features that shape those input responses.","Inhibition-stabilized network (ISN) models of the cerebral cortex predict that local (recurrent) synaptic connectivity plays a vital role in shaping cortical activity. Yet it has been experimentally unclear if cortical recurrent connectivity is strong enough to make ISNs good descriptions of cortical function. Here we test several ISN predictions, including the counterintuitive (paradoxical) suppression of inhibitory firing when the inhibitory network is stimulated. We pair, in awake subjects, optogenetic stimulation of all inhibitory subtypes with in vivo pharmacology to identify inhibitory cells. We observe responses consistent with an ISN in the upper layers of visual, somatosensory, and motor cortex. Stimulating parvalbumin (PV)-positive inhibitory neurons produces a population paradoxical effect only with transgenic, not viral, opsin expression. This effect is explained in a model where viral expression targets a subset of PV cells, showing inhibitory cell responses to stimulation can be highly dependent on the number of stimulated cells.We have also examined paradoxical neural responses that arise from input to not just inhibitory, but also excitatory neurons. We show that the recurrent connections in the cortex can create suppression when excitatory cells are excited, which intuitively should lead only to elevated firing rates in cortical cells.We first observe that intense visual inputs create a salt-and-pepper pattern of suppressed and excited neurons in mouse V1. To selectively examine the recurrent contributions to suppression, we stimulate excitatory neurons optogenetically, and measure responses using electrophysiological recordings and calcium imaging at the 2-photon cellular level and widefield population level. When cortical excitatory cells are excited directly, we find suppressed cells in a similar salt-and-pepper pattern as with strong visual input. Though we drive only excitatory neurons, both excitatory and inhibitory neural populations settle into similarly distributed steady states, with some cells elevated and some suppressed. Suppressed cells are distributed across the cortex, though widefield imaging reveals a surround showing  suppression a few hundred microns away from the center of stimulation. A moderately or strongly coupled balanced-state cortical model with heterogeneous local connectivity can account for the results, displaying suppression due to recurrent connectivity even when only excitation is added to the network.  The mechanism for paradoxical suppression with excitatory input is different than that for paradoxical responses to inhibitory input, though both depend on strong recurrent connectivity. For excitatory cell input, it is the variability in the number of connections each cell receives that accounts for suppression  that is, some neurons receive few excitatory inputs and are suppressed, while others receive many excitatory inputs and their rates are elevated.  This variability in local, recurrent connectivity is a novel mechanism to shape input-output transformations, and one that is essential to understand sensory cortical function, as this mechanism is needed to explain the suppression seen for strong visual input. Taken together, our results show that one function of recurrent cortical connectivity is to shape individual neurons steady-state responses to input.  Such shaping of responses by recurrent connectivity is an essential feature of cortical computation, and thus of brain function. Our work helps explain why recurrent connections in cortical circuits are so pervasive, and in continuing work, we are further elaborating the computational role of cortical recurrent connections.","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

New treatments are needed, as developmentally applied interventions targeting aberrant mechanisms may lead to better long-term outcomes. The goal of the Neuroscience and Novel Therapeutics Unit (NNT) is to address this need by integrating brain-based studies, scalable mobile technology, and clinical trials of novel interventions for pediatric psychiatric disorders. Given metabolic and other long- and short-term side effects of psychiatric medications on the developing brain, coupled with the pathophysiological malleability of children through learning and social contexts, NNT focuses on developing psychological interventions for youth (Brotman et al., 2017). NNT leverages a translational neuroscience approach, guided by a theoretical framework that articulates two core pathophysiological mechanisms underlying irritability and anxiety in youth: (1) aberrant threat responding and (2) impaired inhibitory control. These two mechanisms constitute promising targets for intervention. Youth with irritability and anxiety demonstrate aberrant responses to threat and deficits in inhibitory control. By probing aberrant threat responses and inhibitory control, NNT seeks to identify both shared and unique behavioral and neural features of irritability and anxiety. To this end, NNT employs computational modeling to identify a data-driven phenotype of co-occurring irritability and anxiety, here termed negative affectivity. Thus, NNT embraces complex taxonomy by applying a computational phenotyping framework. By decomposing clinical phenomena, we probe shared vs. unique behavioral and neural mechanisms underpinning the clinical components, which provide the foundation for the development of novel interventions. Specifically, we probe threat and inhibitory control using behavioral and fMRI paradigms to identify targets and develop novel interventions.Work was conducted under protocols NCT02531893, NCT00025935, and NCT00018057.","First, in 2021, our program completed a multiple baseline  novel frustration-exposure intervention for youth with severe irritability based on extinction principles. We published a protocol paper; N=41 youth were randomized; preliminary analyses demonstrated that irritability scores decreased significantly from the start of therapy to end of therapy. NNT acquires pre-treatment behavioral and task-based fMRI data to test the hypothesis that pre-treatment behavioral deficits in inhibition predict poorer treatment response.Second, in 2021, we published a randomized controlled trial (N=44, active vs. placebo) of a computer-based treatment engaging behavioral and neural targets of aberrant threat processing. In addition, we developed an analogous fMRI paradigm to probe neural correlates in a large (N>100) sample of youth with varying degrees of irritability. We found unique neural correlates associated with latent factor-derived phenotype of high irritability and anxiety.Third, we leverage technology to assess symptoms by utilizing digitally based event sampling (ecological momentary assessment). We collected data on over 100 youth and our manuscript is now in press. We developed a cognitive inhibition mobile application to probe children's inhibitory control.  We published a protocol paper and have administered to over 50 youth remotely. These interventions provide the foundation for scalable, target-based interventions which are more easily disseminated, facilitating public health impact.Fourth, we published three additional behavioral phenotype papers probing threat attention, extinction recall, and, inhibitory control in youth with irritability and anxiety. Fifth, as threats engage evolutionarily conserved processes, our translational perspective has been supported by two Bench-to-Bedside Awards. Specifically, we reverse translated the Human Intruder Paradigm, (Kalin & Shelton 1989) into two clinical paradigms. Our fMRI (N=60) and eye-tracking (N=60) tasks parallel work in non-human primates. Ultimately, these mechanistic studies will allow for more targeted interventions for pathological irritability.Finally, the acute onset of the COVID-19 pandemic provides a rare opportunity to utilize existing pre-stress clinical and neural data to predict stress-related increases in psychopathology and associated neural dysfunction. In this study, we are examining associations among stress, genetic liability, brain function, and the development of psychopathology.","Ordered by reference within the summary, then by publication type and author name.

The mesocorticolimbic system is highly enriched in monoaminergic and peptidergic neuromodulators, such as endogenous opioid peptides, whose activity is regulated by stress and arousal. However, there is a critical knowledge gap in our understanding of how these neuromodulators shape synaptic transmission and intrinsic excitability in motivational and limbic networks to control adaptive motivated behavior. Moreover, it is unclear how neuromodulation of motivational circuits by opioid peptides is impacted by stressful, adverse life experiences to promote mal-adaptive behavioral states marked with motivational and reward-processing deficits.The overall mission of the Neuromodulation and Synaptic Integration Unit is to delineate how stress-related neuromodulators, such as endogenous opioid peptides, modify motivational and emotional circuitry to promote adaptive behavioral responses to physical and psychological threats. We are also interested in identifying the role of stress-related neuromodulators in driving mal-adaptive behaviors, including reward and motivational deficits, induced by significant, adverse life experiences. We are particularly interested in the opioid peptide dynorphin and its cognate receptor, the kappa-opioid receptor (KOR), as a model peptidergic system that is mobilized by stress, is highly enriched in motivational circuitry, and whose signaling drives negative affect and motivational deficits. Our group is focused on elucidating how dynorphin/KOR neuromodulation shapes synaptic integration in motivational circuits to produce stress-induced mal-adaptive changes in reward and motivated behavior.","In the last fiscal year, the Neuromodulation and Synaptic Integration Unit has dissected the function of the dynorphin / KOR system in regulating prefrontal cortex (PFC) circuit dynamics and the role of this system in the PFC in shaping stress reactivity. We have generated an anatomical framework for how the dynorphin / KOR system is embedded in the PFC. This includes mapping the outputs of dynorphin-containing PFC cells to the rest of the brain, identifying the laminar organization of various excitatory projection and local-circuit inhibitory dynorphin-expressing cells, as well as the electrophysiological and morphological properties of dynorphin-expressing neurons. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that local-circuit PFC cells and afferents inputs expressing the KOR display a laminar organization. Since the laminar organization of cortical circuits is integral for information processing and execution of PFC-dependent behaviors, these data suggest that laminar organization of PFC dynorphin cell and KOR-expressing afferent inputs and PFC KOR cells, may contribute to information processing in ways not currently understood. Furthermore, we have delineated how stress recruits different PFC dynorphin-expressing neuronal populations and mobilizes dynorphin/KOR signaling utilizing in-vivo imaging approaches. We have demonstrated that PFC dynorphin-expressing cells show more threat-related changes in activity relative to dynorphin-lacking counterparts. We have also identified threat-induced changes in activity of excitatory and inhibitory PFC dynorphin cells. Further, we have elucidated the role of dynorphin release and subsequent kappa-opioid receptor activation in mediating physiological and behavioral arousal induced by stress utilizing a novel fluorescence-based kappa-opioid receptor sensor and genetic/viral approaches to ablate prodynorphin gene expression. These studies advance our understanding of how cells that constitute the PFC dynorphin / KOR system are engaged by threats and utilize this peptidergic transmitter to change emotionally-charged behavior. Finally, we have demonstrated that dynorphin release has functional effects on cortical circuits via KOR signaling utilizing a combination of patch clamp electrophysiology and optogenetics. Dyn / KOR signaling inhibits excitatory synaptic transmission coming into the PFC from the thalamus and amygdala by directly acting on the presynaptic terminals of these afferents. Interestingly, other limbic inputs like the hippocampus are not regulated by the dynorphin / KOR system. Despite KORs decreasing excitatory inputs to the PFC in an input-specific manner, the net result of dynorphin signaling is a massive loss of feedforward/feedback inhibition (disinhibition), as dynorphin decreases excitatory drive of inhibitory interneurons. Even inputs that are KOR insensitive, like those coming from the hippocampus, are disinhibited by dynorphin/KOR signaling, emphasizing a local circuit mechanism by which dynorphin / KOR signaling shuts down feedforward/feedback inhibition. We find very sparse KOR expression in GABAergic interneurons and no evidence of direct actions of dynorphins on GABAergic interneurons, emphasizing that dynorphins indirectly depress excitatory drive of GABAergic circuits to limit PFC inhibition. We are currently utilizing cell-type specific pharmacology and knockout of KOR expression to further dissect the microcircuits through which dynorphin/KOR disintegrates inhibitory signaling in the PFC. Overall, this last fiscal year our group has laid the foundation to deconstruct the role of the dynorphin/kappa-opioid receptor system in mediating the effects of stress on PFC circuits critical for emotion, motivation, and cognition. These findings are of relevance as disinhibition of cortical circuits is implicated in mediating disruptions in cognition in various neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, and kappa-opioid receptor activation produces cognitive disruptions and psychotomimetic effects in humans. Furthermore, KOR ligands are being developed for the treatment of addictive and mood disorders, and this work may elucidate the mechanism by which KOR ligands may have therapeutic effects in treating neuropsychiatric disorders and reveal novel approaches to target this system to treat these disorders.",There were no publications during this reporting period,"[('Yogita  Chudasama, PhD Office of the Director', 'Office of the Director'), ('Samer Saleh Hattar, PhD Office of the Director', 'Office of the Director'), ('Theodore B Usdin, MD  Systems Neuroscience Imaging Resource', 'Systems Neuroscience Imaging Resource')]",,

These processes have largely been studied separately. Thus, although many spatiotemporal features of neural population activity have been shown to carry sensory information, it is often unknown which features the brain uses for perception and behavior. Understanding brain functions requires unifying principles of neural coding and readout, but three key challenges have made this problem particularly difficult. First, demonstrating causality requires linking behavior to brain activity with precise interventional tools that change neural circuit dynamics at their native spatiotemporal specificity and scope; until recently, this has not been possible. Second, each sensory system has unique coding properties dictated by the physics of its stimuli, but their output must be read out by higher-order systems that identify objects in the abstract. As a result, it is difficult to generalize coding/readout principles while studying any single sense. Third, little work has been done to develop a theoretical framework for unifying neural coding and readout.The goal of our consortium is to reveal fundamental principles of brain function by determining which aspects of neural codes are read out to guide behavior.

Finally, we have advanced a strong theoretical framework for integrating the insights from across the different sensory systems. The Data Science Core will manage the integration of data and data modeling across the sensory systems and theoretical framework. We will achieve our goals through the following Projects, which will be coordinated by our Administrative Core.Project 1: Determining which neurons contribute to a particular behaviorally distinguishable percept. Paramount to studying neural codes is knowing which neurons are doing the encoding. The onset of any stimulus activates an extensive population of neurons, but without cell-specific causal interventions, it is impossible to know which subset contributes to a behavioral response. Here we will develop, validate, and apply our approach to determine the relative behavioral weighting given to individual neurons with different stimulus selectivities, laminar positions, genetic identities, and axonal projection targets.Project 2: Determining the contribution of relative timing of activities across neurons in coding behaviorally distinguishable percepts. Typical behaviors involve sensory cell responses that span tens or hundreds of milliseconds, but the behavioral significance of fluctuations in spike rate over these periods remains largely unknown. Project 2 will measure how behavioral choices integrate spikes over time and will determine the temporal resolution of readout mechanisms.Project 3: Determining how neural coding and readout depend on internal state and past  experience. The context in which sensory signals are processed is constantly changing, but the mechanisms and principles that neuronal circuits use to accommodate or exploit those changes remain poorly understood.","During the third year of this U19 grant, we made substantial progress in quantifying the performance of our in vivo 2-photon imaging (2PI) in combination with spatial light modulation for single cell stimulation in the awake animal.1. Spatiotemporal precision in optical stimulation of single nerve cells in the awake animal.We took advantage of the higher spatial resolution in our upgraded Spatial Light Modulation (SLM) system and the increase in laser stimulation efficiency due to our recent up-grade to a low-repetition laser. We experimentally obtained stimulation profile functions, which allowed us to optimize our stimulation protocols to excite single nerve cells inside the brain of a mouse.  We reliably obtained single cell responses during temporally and spatially precise SLM stimulation in the mouse brain. 2. Areal and interareal targeting of neuronal activity.  We further optimized our ability to identify primary and higher-order visual areas in the cortex of living mice.  These high-precision maps are important for targeted stimulation in the brain.  This line of research was further expanded by the successful installation of a 2-photon imaging mesoscope in conjunction with the Histed group.  The mesoscope will allow for simultaneous recording of several brain areas with high cellular resolution. 3. Advances in identifying critical brain dynamics.Our theoretical analysis and computer simulations established box-scaling as a robust approach to overcome limitations in 2-photon imaging.  Specifically, 2-photon imaging limits access to brain dynamics through a recording window, which affects the identification of critical brain dynamics.  By introducing a systematic change in window size, the effect of such windowing can be estimated through a procedure called scaling.","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

We have deployed a dual-laser custom microscope capable of imaging and stimulation. To make cortical neurons accessible for imaging activity and stimulation, we have developed an approach to express soma-targeted ChrimsonR (stChrimsonR) combined with expression of GCaMP variants. This allows high efficiency all-optical stimulation at 1030 nm (laser repetition rate: 500 kHz) and imaging at 920 nm (laser repetition rate: 80 MHz).To assess the effect of stimulating spatial and temporal patterns, we have done preliminary work to show which V1 spikes generated by a visual stimulus are used by the animal in detection behavior. We have measured the effect of inhibiting V1 at different times relative to stimulus onset. Resulaj et al. (2018 eLife) previously reported that only early spikes of V1 (in the first 40-80 ms of V1 neurons stimulus response) were used for visual discrimination, but they observed no effect on visual detection. We used a near-threshold change detection task, in VGAT-ChR2 animals that detected a contrast increment of a visual grating. One-photon optical stimulation was delivered to the surface of visual cortex. We found the same effect holds for visual detection: only the early spikes of V1 responses (within the first 80ms) are used.We have also demonstrated that secondary visual areas play a role in very simple visuomotor behaviors in which all information should be available in primary visual cortex. This work sheds light on the network of cortical brain areas that control perceptual behavior for example, does information flow directly from primary visual cortex to frontal or motor areas, or does it pass through secondary areas?Primary visual cortex (V1) projects to numerous brain areas, including several secondary visual areas, frontal cortex, and basal ganglia. While it has been demonstrated that optogenetic silencing of V1 strongly impairs visually-guided behavior, it is not known which downstream areas are required for visual behaviors.Optogenetic silencing of visual responses in secondary visual areas revealed that their activity is required for even this simple visual task. In vivo electrophysiology showed that, although inhibiting secondary visual areas could produce some feedback effects in V1, the principal effect was profound suppression at the location of the optogenetic light. The results show that pathways through secondary visual areas are necessary for even simple visual behaviors.We have developed and refined a robust protocol to co-express stChrimsonR and GCaMP8s in the same cortical neurons in vivo and have shared this protocol with the consortium.","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

One important example of a canonical computation is the summation of various driving, contextual, and modulatory neuronal inputs to yield spiking output. The question of how cortical networks integrate these inputs and transform them into spiking outputs of individual neurons is of central importance to neuroscience. A significant challenge to understanding these computations is that each neuron is embedded within a larger circuit of neurons, each modulating one another's activity, so that understanding how a particular neuron responds to input necessarily involves understanding the larger circuit. Recent optogenetic studies have found different patterns of input summation in different cortical areas. Recently developed theoretical models have produced specific predictions about the differences in network circuitry that can lead to differences in summation and predict how summation non-linearities depend on inputs to the network. The proposed research will test these predictions and seek to understand these circuit computations using a combination of theoretical work and optogenetic modulation. Taken together, our aims will help define the roles played by excitatory and inhibitory neurons in mediating summation of neuronal inputs to yield spiking output. This information will be critical for understanding brain disorders associated with failures in perception and attention, as is seen with autism, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease.","We have obtained data showing that inhibitory stabilized network (ISN) models describe several areas of the cortex. This means that recurrent coupling is strong enough to make the excitatory neurons unstable in the absence of reactive inhibition. Together with the Brunel group, we used inference in several simple rate-based models to provide further evidence that inhibition-stabilized-network (ISN) models can describe the data. An ISN model captures responses to different stimulation strengths and the dynamics of responses simultaneously. The data and the model together provide strong evidence that cortical responses are strongly affected by recurrent excitatory-inhibitory interconnections; the data cannot be explained by intra-laminar feedforward or multi-inhibitory-population disinhibitory models. This work places important constraints on the possible set of network models that can describe cortical activity.We have also investigated, with the Brunel lab, how networks of spiking neurons respond to inputs, and characterized their transfer function (i.e., how the population firing rate depends on the mean inputs to the network). This was done in two classes of models, current-based and conductance-based. Current theories make distinct predictions about the shape of this transfer function. The balanced network model predicts a linear transfer function, while the stabilized supralinear network model (SSN) can generate various types of nonlinearities.We investigated numerically and analytically the response of networks of current-based spiking neurons as a function of coupling strength. We showed that, while a linear transfer function is obtained in the strong coupling (balanced network) limit, nonlinearities appear as the coupling is decreased. We found that these nonlinearities are present both at response onset and at saturation, and systematically characterized how they are shaped by single neuron properties and network connectivity. All SSN nonlinearities can be generated, but other regimes are also present. Work in future project periods will experimentally seek to determine the operating regime used in biological cortical networks.We have also examined the universality of the balanced state model for cortical function, a foundational model for the function of cortical networks (for review, see Ahmadian and Miller, 2019). First proposed to explain the irregular firing seen in cortical circuits, the balanced state theoretical work was performed in binary neurons (i.e., those that can fire only at rates zero or one), and then extended to current-based spiking networks. Current-based neurons are simplified versions of real neurons, and in current-based models, synaptic strengths are not dependent on the membrane potential of the neuron as they are in real neurons. Conductance-based network models take this feature of real neurons into account. We showed (Sanzeni et al., 2020) that conductance-based models fundamentally cannot be described by the balanced network theory. The synaptic scaling rule that defines the balanced state, which is that average synaptic strength varies as 1/sqrt(N), where N is the total number of inputs to a cell, is not possible in conductance-based networks.  We show mathematically that this rule  and any possible modification of the rule that preserves balance  produces constant, regular firing rates, violating experimental observations in the cortex. Balanced states can still exist, but they exist in only well-defined regimes of synaptic strength and number of inputs. Continuing intramural work in the laboratory seeks to determine whether this tuned balanced regime is pervasive in many cortical areas, and if there are learning rules that maintain this state.Other collaborative work within this project has progressed in this reporting year. We have compared input-output functions (computations) in visual cortex of several species, showing that optogenetic perturbations in both species produce large heterogeneity in cortical responses.  Continuing work aims to determine the possible circuit sources of the observed differences in responses when external input is applied to a subset of cells. The goal of this project has been to determine what kinds of models describe cortical networks in vivo. We have made several discoveries, including that the so-called strong coupling theoretical regime applies to many cortical areas, and that network phenomena shape the input-output functions of cortical neurons. The progress made here positions us to understand, using models that make testable predictions, how biological neurons embedded in their networks compute by transforming inputs to outputs.References:Sanzeni A, Histed MH, Brunel N.

Commercially available MEG systems based on superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) are limited in spatial resolution, largely because the sensors cannot be placed directly on the scalp. SQUID devices require refrigeration, usually using liquid helium, to 4.2 degrees Kelvin. In contrast, optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) operate near room temperature. Although there are no commercial MEG instruments based on OPM sensors, experimental instruments are currently in development by several groups; however, the focus has been on wearable systems that can be utilized while a subject is in motion, similar to EEG. The goal of this project is quite different. Currently, the only option for high resolution direct mapping of neuronal activity is electrocorticography (ECoG), where electrode grids are placed directly on the cortical surface. This requires a craniotomy, carries serious risks of morbidity and mortality, and is only performed in situations such as presurgical planning for epilepsy. As a result, most of the knowledge neuroscientists have obtained for human subjects is from ECoG studies of abnormal brains. The goal of this project is the development of a novel OPM system that will be capable of magnetocorticography (MCoG), magnetic field mapping of the cortex at a resolution on par with that of ECoG.This project will involve the expansion of a pilot 19-channel (3 reference channels and 16 primary channels) system obtained under NIH IRP funding. This expansion includes the completion of 56 channel system with three reference sensors, although smaller interim arrays may be constructed to overcome engineering hurdles with the larger array. The system must be carefully calibrated using a specially designed calibration jig with 37 coils producing known magnetic fields. Following construction of the 56-channel system, performance and spatial resolution will be assessed using a somatosensory task to map the receptive fields of each finger and the proximal, middle, and distal phalanx of each finger. Additional tests may be explored to assess other sensory domains. All experiments involving human subjects will occur under clinical protocol NCT04950309.","Due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, this project has been substantially delayed. We received our original 19 channel system in November of 2020. Also, in late 2020 the Section on Instrumentation completed work on a 3D printed array fixture to hold our sensors, as well as a calibration jig and associated electronics. After receiving the sensors, and performing extensive testing with our calibrator, we were able to identify several issues with the sensors that we worked on with the vendor to address. Changes resulted from this included a more reliable automated calibration process, better field nulling in the presence of crosstalk, and more robust connections between the sensors and associated cabling. In addition, we revised our calibration device to allow for a larger dynamic range of field strengths, and further refined our calibration software. During this testing phase, we observed spike noise on multiple channels; this necessitated the temporary return of our sensors to the vendor. In July, we received our original 19 sensors back, along with 45 additional sensors procured with Brain Initiative funding. We have begun testing of these sensors and have begun work with the section on instrumentation to begin construction of a 56-channel array with 3 reference sensors. One crucial issue will be thermal management, as the sensors generate heat. We hope to have calibration measurements completed by the end of FY21, with human studies beginning in early FY22.Due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, our hiring of a scientist dedicated to this project was delayed.

The panel noted lack of standard data formats and data repositories to encourage and enforce their use has prevented data sharing and reproducible analysis practices from becoming common in the PET literature. This project, funded by the BRAIN initiative, uses the tools and lessons learned in the MRI community (e.g. the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), OpenNeuro) to make PET data sharing simple, standardized, and commonplace. Freely available analysis tools are also being developed to improve the reproducibility of PET analysis pipelines.","BackgroundIn recent years, the importance of data sharing has increasingly been recognized by the neuroimaging community because of the poor replicability of findings, the need for appropriate quality control, the greater statistical power provided by larger samples, and the higher scientific impact of multilateral collaborations. Our funding bodies and scientific journals also increasingly encourage or require that the data be shared. However, data sharing can be clumsy and cumbersome in the absence of well articulated guidelines, clear data formatting standards, and well managed repositories.  Building on the recommendations of leaders in the PET field, and in collaboration with other highly successful repositories of human neuroimaging data, an application was submitted to the NIH BRAIN initiative for funding to establish a useful and freely-shared repository for human brain PET data. That application was favorably reviewed and awarded funding in 2021 and our work commenced.Standards & NomenclatureFrom the beginning, we have understood that open standards for both nomenclatures and data formats were critical to this project's success. Following a highly collaborative process including a wide array of leading PET researchers in the field, our paper on consensus nomenclature was published last year in Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism. The next step was to standardize PET data formats for sharing. Our colleagues in Copenhagen led the effort to establish this new standard as an extension to the Brain Imaging Data Standard (BIDS). This standard was finalized earlier this year and the associated paper is now on the bioRxiv preprint server.ToolsAnother critical part of this project was to build tools that make conversion to and manipulation of BIDS formatted PET data. We have hired a software engineer to build a tools that will take data as it comes off of the PET scanner and additional information such as radiotracer concentration blood measurements) and convert them into a standard BIDS dataset. We are also collaborating with the authors of leading PET analysis software packages (e.g. Doug Greve author of PET Surfer) to make BIDS-formatted PET dataset easily loaded and analyzed. This work is on going.RepositoryFinally this project requires a data repository that is well-designed, easy-to-use, and built upon community standards. For this we have contracted the team that built the original OpenNeuro site, Squishy Media. We have been working with them intensively over the past 10 months to build out the site. The new site will not only advance PET data sharing, but will also allow OpenNeuro to better integrate many other neuroimage modalities for which new BIDS specification have recently been published (e.g. EEG, iEEG, MEG) At the time of this writing we have just submitted feedback on the final release candidate for the repository.

This is important because deficits in motivation have been linked to various psychiatric disorders. Current research on this topic have largely focused on investigating the contribution of the dopaminergic meso-accumbens pathway to this process. However, the role that glutamatergic inputs to the NAc play in the control of motivation is far less clear. The paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) sends prominent glutamatergic projections to the NAc and in turn receives homeostatic signals from areas such as the hypothalamus and brainstem. Interestingly, recent studies (including work from our group) has shown that the PVT-NAc pathway supports both appetitive and aversive instrumental behaviors, suggesting that the PVT controls motivated behaviors. But the precise mechanisms by which PVT projections to the NAc influence different components of motivated behavior remain unknown.To address this question we are investigating the functional organization of the PVT-NAc neuronal circuit by using a multidisciplinary approach that includes mouse genetics, electrophysiology, neuroimaging and behavior. Since motivational deficits are a core feature of highly prevalent psychiatric disorders (e.g., For drug-abuse or obsessive-compulsive disorder, major depressive disorder, and others), this research may provide insights into potential therapeutic targets for these psychiatric disorders. Lastly the research conducted here seeks to provide fundamental insight into the neural mechanisms that mediate motivated behaviors","Over the course of FY21, we concluded and published an independent research study that highlighted a previously neglected role for the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) in driving goal-directed behaviors. In this study, we showed that the PVT is part of a brain circuit that promotes food-seeking behavior in response to chemically induced hypoglycemia (Beas et al., 2020). Specifically, this study implicated PVT projections to the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a ventral-striatal region previously linked to goal-directed behaviors in food-seeking behavior. Notably, our findings highlighted the PVT as a critical node in the control of glucose homeostasis and answered long-standing questions regarding the neural mechanisms that underlie this process.Our recent publication supports proposals that the PVT is a candidate region for guiding motivated behaviors. However, the circuit and cellular mechanisms that contribute to different components of motivation such as behavioral activation and directionality remain unknown. Our ongoing research efforts are set on addressing this question. We believe that developing such a framework may provide insights into potential therapeutic targets for psychiatric diseases whose core features are motivational deficits.","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

We aim to support as well as to guide the evolving practices of the intramural neuroimaging community by providing a world-class, state-of-the-art MRI service and acquisition capabilities, as well as useful core staff-to-researcher collaborations. We also aim to enhance our role as a hub for cross-lab, cross-institute, and extramural NIH collaborations. A major theme is to optimize and integrate acquisition, temporal noise mitigation, and analyses such that researchers have, at their disposal, both cutting edge acquisition protocols and pulse sequences as well as pipelines for implementing the appropriate pre- and post-processing of the data. We aim to have on all scanners: simultaneous EEG-fMRI, real-time fMRI with feedback to the subject, state of the art motion correction/compensation, high-resolution fMRI capability to routinely resolve cortical layers and columns at 7T, and advanced MRI sequences such as those highlighting structural connectivity, iron deposits, and myelin integrity.  Lastly, we aim to continue improving our software and hardware infrastructure that unifies our imaging & neuromodulation capabilities, informational resources, and analytic capabilities into an organized, searchable, and secure neuroimaging research platform. In 2016, two additional ""teams"" associated with the FMRIF were created. These are the Data Science and Sharing Team and the Machine Learning Team. The vision behind the creation of these teams is that which embraces two emerging trends in fMRI as well as neuroimaging in general. The first is the sharing, pooling, and curating of data sets. The second is the rapid advancement in sophistication of processing methods that includes Machine Learning and Deep Learning approaches. While the goals of these two trends are multifaceted, a major goal in the implementation of these teams is to accelerate the discovery of fMRI and/or MRI-based ""biomarkers"" indicating a disorder or best path to treatment. The key goal is to move fMRI from a method for understanding groups to that of elucidating differences and similarities among individuals, thus increasing clinical traction. Two years ago, Peter Molfese took charge of implementing the vision of the Center for Multimodal Neuroimaging, initially envisioned by Dr. Bandettini in 2016.  To this end, Dr. Molfese has organized monthly training workshops focused on multi-modal neuroimaging taught by both intramural and extramural scientists with expertise in diverse areas.  Dr. Molfese has also devoted significant time to the training of multiple labs within both NIMH and NIAAA on the use of simultaneous EEG-fMRI. The Center for Multimodal neuroimaging launched its second conference on Naturalistic Stimuli and Individual Differences on August 2nd, 2021.  The workshop hosted 12 speakers (12 extramural, 2 intramural), each giving talks ranging from 30-90 minutes on cutting-edge research in the field.  Total registration before the event were 654, and as of today (August 12), there are over 700 views of the recorded stream.  The online workshop will conduct a second phase in September 2021 with two separate roundtable discussions where the presenters will answer questions from conference attendees and general topics in the field.  We are tentatively planning another training workshop targeting combined PET-fMRI for early 2022.","Space Utilization:The Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Facility (FMRIF) currently occupies approximately 5000 sq ft of space in Building 10, divided between the B1level scanner bays, control rooms and electronics/machine rooms for 3TA/3TB, 3TC, and the Siemens 7T-Classic, (about 1800 sq ft, 1100 sq ft and 1300 sq ft respectively) and office space within the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) center. On the first floor are the Functional MRI Facility and the Section on Functional Imaging Methods suites (approximately 800 sq ft total) for office space and shared conference space for all staff employed full-time by the facility.Staff:The FMRIF staff consists of: the facility director, four staff scientists to keep the scanners running, six MRI technologists, and an information technology specialist. Investigators:The functional MRI facility supports the research of over 30 Principal Investigators translating to over 300 researchers overall. Over 70 research protocols are active and making use of FMRIF scanners. Each scanner has scheduled operating hours of 105 hours per week.Core Projects of the Staff Scientists:Vinai RoopchansinghThis year, Vinai has been working with Radiologics to replace FMRIFs current DICOM catchers.  He, Sean Marrett, and Roark Maccado have worked with the vendor's technical support team to work through the various technical issues with this migration. With the conversion of one of FMRIF's 3 Tesla scanners to a 7 Tesla scanner over the coming year, Vinai has worked with the PIs and Institute Directors to reorganize the scanning schedules for FMRIF's 5 MRI scanners, and the NMRF and NIAAA scanners (where NIMH and NINDS PIs also scan) to accommodate to the fullest extent possible, the needs of PIs and their experiments and protocols.Regarding scientific research, Vinai Roopchansingh continued to contribute and develop two open source projects he started over the last couple of years, and continues to support and make available.The first project is a Python library that enables neuro-feedback experiments on General Electric and Siemens MRI scanners, using AFNI in combination with PsychoPy. Vinai also updated the Python library to match AFNIs updated and expanded capabilities in the types of information sent to neuro-feedback programs, as well expand the number and types of sources of information which can be incorporated into neurofeedback experiments. Vinai has also continued his work on the General Electric to ISMRMRD raw MR (i.e., k-space) data converter.  Over the last year, he and Andy Derbyshire have worked to make the converter more robust and capable.  It is now capable of converting and labeling data acquired using 2-dimensional fast spin-echo (FSE) and gradient-recalled echo (GRE) pulse sequences, as well as for echo-planar imaging (EPI) pulse sequences. Linqing LiDr. Linqing Li has provided essential upkeep and upgrades to MRI acquisition and MRI equipment for the neuromodulation core's MRI compatible TMS system. He has also written a T2 prepared 3D-EPI sequence for Danny Reich's group in NINDS. He worked on purchasing and installation of the Optical Fiber of temperature sensor from OSENSA Innovations Corp for the gradient temperature control. He has also been active scientifically in two major projects. The first is research on a new method for ultra-high spatial and, importantly, functional resolution MRI using specialized RF pulses to allow sensitization to blood volume changes  which are more localized to activity. These pulses are called DANTE pulses which tag moving blood with high precision to velocity and direction. He is currently writing up the manuscript for this. He has also been working on a manuscript that advances further establishment of the relationship between brain metabolism and blood flow. He is collaborating with Prof. Nicholas Blockley from University of Nottingham, UK, for data analysis.Sean Marrett Interest in high-resolution FMRI 7T among the FMRIF community continued to develop. Researchers  who have previously scanned only at 3T or 1.5T have modified their IRB protocols to include  7T scanning. Notably, this has included extending some developmental studies to pediatric populations.   VASO is the most popular technique for these studies, as it provides high spatial specificity and less vascular contamination than other methods that are more BOLD-contrast weighted. Dr. Laurentius Huber, a former post-doc in SFIM, has pioneered the development and application of VASO to layer-fMRI. Dr. Marrett has worked with Dr. Huber and provided technical support to local users.  Continuing work began last year with Dr. Huber, Dr. Marrett coordinated sequence testing, characterization, using a broad spectrum of VASO and BOLD methods and variants with the overall goal of providing FMRIF users with methods for whole-brain layer-specific MRI. Data was collected using both the FMRIF-7T (VB17) and NMRF7T (VE12). This testing included tests of the whole brain MAGEC-VASO methods.Dr. Marrett managed the original procurement (FY20) a vendor-supplied upgrade of FMRIF7T-A from the original VB17 to the VE12 imaging platform. The benefits of this work include access to modern pulse sequences, RF power monitoring, and compatibility with other NIH 7T human MRI scanners. Dr. Marrett is managing the FMRIF7T-B project, the replacement of FMRIF3TC with a 7T human scanner (the first FDA approved 7T system). This major project is now under the final stages of NIH design review. Our plan is for the demolition, construction installation to begin in November 2021 with the delivery of the new system in March 2022, followed by installation, calibration, and turn-over of the 7T to FMRIF completed by June 2022. This system will provide the FMRIF community with an FDA-approved 7T scanner, crucial for clinical studies.  Dr. Marrett continued working with the Section on Instrumentation and the Emotional Development Branch to develop operating procedures for eye-tracking on FMRIF3T-A. He has worked closely with new scientific staff in LBC to make 7T eye tracking more routine on FMRIF7T-A. FMRIF also collaborates closely with Dr. Peter Molfese (CMN) to support concurrent high-density EEG data collection on all 3T scanners.  Dr. Marrett supervises the FMRIF system administrator, Mr. Roark Maccado. Work on deploying a new scientific imaging database based on the open-source XNAT platform is advancing rapidly. Dr. Marrett has supported Dr. Roopchansingh by managing the expansion of FMRIF computational and data storage resources, and by managing the transfer of more than 100 terabytes of existing historical imaging data to the new system.  John (Andy) DerbyshireDuring 2021, Andy assumed responsibility from Vinai Roopchansingh to provide coordination of the FMRIF user community with the FMRIF MRI Technologists. Dr. Derbyshire continues to be the FMRIF lead in the FMRIF/NIBIB insertable head gradient project. He worked with Dr. Pierpaoli (NIBIB) to acquire an MR field camera which can accurately determine the variations of the gradient fields used for MR image encoding.   He provides support installing and maintaining the Siemens Pulse Sequence development environment within the MR Center, including support for all five FMRIF MRI systems plus the NMRF 7T and NIAAA 3T scanners as well as assistance to users with pulse-sequence programming.  3D EPI Pulse sequence Development. We are continuing to work with Pascal Sati (Riech/NINDS) in the development and evolution of their susceptibility contrast 3D-EPI pulse sequence.Dr. Derbyshire is deeply involved with NMR Center safety training and is a member of the safety committee.

A secondary goal is to provide some general statistical consulting to NIH intramural investigators (not necessarily limited to analysis of imaging datasets).fMRI and MRI data analysis is challenging, since the amount of data involved is huge (multiple gigabytes per participant, and 20-100+ participants per study), numerous complex processing steps are required to extract the small components of the data that are relevant to brain activity and networks, and in most cases there is no universally agreed upon set of analysis methods to apply. The state-of-the-art in both image acquisition technology and analysis methodology is in continual flux, is racked by occasional controversies and panics, has no ""cut and dried"" or fully automated solutions, and new MRI-based projects often require new or modified types of statistical analysis. The Scientific and Statistical Computing Core educates users in the techniques of (f)MRI analyses, and consults with users about the details of their specific research projects and how to carry out their data analyses in various software tools, including Analysis of Functional NeuroImages (AFNI), Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM), Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain (FMRIB) Software Library (FSL), and FreeSurfer.The Core also develops new processing methods, or adapts them from the research literature, and implements them in software (AFNI), so intramural researchers will have access to the reliable and flexible tools they need. Many changes to AFNI are motivated by intramural researchers' specific requests and needs; other upgrades are based on the Core's vision of what will be useful in the future. The Core is aggressive at fixing bugs in the software, usually within a few days. These open-source software tools are also made available to non-NIH researchers (https://afni.nimh.nih.gov and https://github.com/afni), and are used at dozens of institutions around the world (https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=12018187295487458974). Software support is provided by a Web-based message board, by teaching a multi-day course on how to analyze fMRI data with the Core's software (now available on videos), and by meetings with NIH intramural researchers to help them understand their data and the analysis options.The Core does not collect human or animal data for its own projects. All data handled by the Core comes from NIH investigators, typically in conjunction with questions about data quality and/or data analysis. Such consultations can range from minutes to hours and are often prolonged over the course of a research study.","The principal mission of the Core is to help NIH researchers with analyses of their fMRI (brain activation mapping) and structural MRI (brain anatomy) data. Along the way, we also help non-NIH investigators, many in the USA but also some abroad. Several levels of help are provided, from short-term immediate aid to long-term development and planning.Consultations:The shortest-term help comprises in-person consultations with investigators about issues that arise in their research. The issues involved are quite varied, since there are many steps in carrying out fMRI and MRI data analyses and there are many different types of experiments. Common problems include:- How to set up experimental design so that data can be analyzed effectively?- Interpretation and correction of MRI imaging artifacts (for example: participant head motion during scanning; image warping due to magnetic field anomalies).- How to set up time series analysis to extract brain activation effects of interest, and to suppress non-activation imaging artifacts (e.g., from breathing)?- Why don't AFNI results agree with SPM/FSL/other software?- How to analyze data to reveal connections between brain regions during specific mental tasks, or at rest?- How to recognize poor quality data?- How to carry out reliable inter-patient (group) statistical analysis, especially when non-MRI data (e.g., genetic information, age, disease rating) needs to be incorporated?- How to get good alignment between the functional results and the anatomical reference images, and between the brain images from different participants?- What sequence of programs is ""best"" for analyzing a particular kind of data?- Reports of real or imagined bugs in the AFNI software, as well as feature requests (small, large, extravagant).- Analysis problems related to diffusion weighted MRI data, which are acquired to reveal anatomical connections in the brain.There are familiar themes in many of these consultations, but each meeting and each experiment raises unique questions, and requires digging into the goals and details of the research project in order to ensure that nothing critical is being overlooked. The first question asked by a user is often not the right question at all. Complex statistical or data processing issues are often raised. Often, software needs to be developed or modified to help researchers answer their specific questions. Helping with the Methods sections of papers, or with responses to reviewers, is often part of our duties.Educational Efforts:The Core has developed (and updated) a 40-hour hands-on course on how to design and analyze fMRI data. All material for this continually evolving course (software, sample data, scripts, PDF slides, captioned videos) are freely available on our Web site (https://afni.nimh.nih.gov). The course material includes sample datasets, used to illustrate the entire process, starting with images output by MRI scanners and continuing through to the collective statistical analysis of groups of participants. The Covid-19 pandemic canceled in-person training courses; instead, we accelerated our production of AFNI Academy videos. More than 1000 AFNI forum postings were made by Core members, mostly in answer to queries from users.Algorithm and Software Development:The longest-term support consists of developing (or adapting) new methods and software for MRI data analysis, both to solve current problems and in anticipation of new needs. All of our software is incorporated into the AFNI package, which is Unix/Linux/Macintosh-based open-source and is available for download by anyone in source code (GitHub) or binary formats (Core server). New programs are created, and old programs modified, in response to specific user requests and in response to the Core's vision of what will be needed in the future. The Core also assists NIH labs in setting up computer systems for use with AFNI and maintains an active Web site with a forum for questions (and answers) about (f)MRI data analysis. In this second year of the coronavirus, consultations and presentations were carried out with Zoom.Notable developments during FY 2021 include:- New demos of AFNI programs and pipelines for various user applications, available for download on the AFNI website.- Expanded the automatic Quality Control output of the main program for creating fMRI pipelines (afni_proc.py) to help researchers check their processing efficiently.- Add new pipelines, and improved older ones, for processing (f)MRI data from macaques, including nonlinear image warping to templates. Assisted with methods in the development of 4 new macaque templates.- Developed alignment tools for brain images from patients with very large lesions (e.g., hemispherectomies and lobectomies) (with Carnegie Mellon U)- Started a project using machine learning methods for brain image skull stripping and tissue classification.- New capabilities for viewing brain surface layers, to improve visualization of the new layer-fMRI imaging techniques developed in SFIM (Bandettini) and with extramural collaborators.- Developed new methods for test-retest reliability at the individual trial-level, rather than at the combined run-level, to allow for random fluctuations in individual trial responses that have not been taken into account in previous analyses (program 3dLMEr-TRR).- Developed methods for applying nonlinear multilevel splines to fMRI longitudinal group studies (program 3dMSS).- Made changes to the software and compilation process to be able to build the AFNI package on Apples new M1 processor computers (significantly faster than Intel-based systems).Public Health Impact:From Oct 2019 to Aug 2020, the principal AFNI publication has been cited in 577 papers (cf Scopus). Most of our work supports basic research into brain function, but some of our work is more closely tied to or applicable to specific diseases:- We collaborate with Dr. Alex Martin (NIMH) to apply our resting state analysis methods to autism spectrum disorder.- We consult frequently with NIMH researchers (e.g., Drs. Pine, Ernst, Grillon, Leibenluft) working in mood and anxiety disorders.- We consult with Dr. Elliot Stein (NIDA) in his research applying fMRI methods to drug abuse and addiction, and with Dr. Reza Momenan (NIAAA) in his studies of alcoholism.- We collaborate with Dr Ernesta Meintjes (U Cape Town) on data analysis of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the brains of infants and toddlers.- Our instant 3D correlation tool is being used for mapping intact brain tissue in stroke patients, and for mapping brain connectivity to aid in deep-brain stimulation surgical planning.- Our precise registration tools (for aligning fMRI scans to anatomical reference scans) are important for individual participant applications of brain mapping, such as pre-surgical fMRI planning.- Our real-time fMRI software (first in the world) is being used for studies on brain mapping feedback in neurological disorders, is used daily for quality control at the NIH fMRI scanners, and is used at several extramural sites.- Components of AFNI are being used in analyses of drug effects in human brain data, including studies of depression, drug abuse, psychosis, and smoking (based on citations in FY 2020).","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

This includes consultation on experimental design, training in data acquisition, support and training in data analytic methods, and consultation on the interpretation of complex findings. A secondary goal of the Core Facility is education and training. This is accomplished through courses, workshops, and one-on-one training and assistance. A tertiary goal of the MEG core facility is to undertake projects of benefit to the greater MEG community, which includes hosting workshops, coordinating reliability studies, development and testing of methods designed to increase data quality, and development and testing of new analytic methods.Because the MEG community is relatively small compared to the fMRI community, many investigators come to the Core Facility with only basic knowledge of MEG. In addition, due to the complexity of neurophysiological signals, data processing requires a substantial amount of knowledge and training. Many of our investigators are cognitive neuroscientists; analysis of data acquired using complex cognitive paradigms is complicated and frequently involves an idiosyncratic approach. Thus, MEG Core Facility expertise in MEG data analysis is vital to the primary mission of the core.","SummaryHardware:The Magnetoencephalography (MEG) Core operates a state-of-the-art 275 channel MEG system (CTF , Coluitlam, BC, Canada). A complete assortment of stimulus delivery and subject response equipment is interfaced to the MEG system. A near 100% helium recycling system was installed in November of 2020 to protect future maintenance of the MEG system against volatility in the global helium market. This extremely complex system is the first that CTF has installed and is currently undergoing repairs. We hope to have the system operating at full capacity in late FY21.The MEG Core Facility has continued its development of a novel optically pumped magnetometer (OPM) system. With a combination of IRP and Brain Initiative funding (ZIA MH-0002975) we have acquired 64 sensors, with which we plan to build a 56 channel array and three reference sensors (with additional spare sensors for redundancy). We have an ongoing collaboration with George Dold and the Section on Instrumentation, they have constructed a calibration device and a 16 channel fixture, and we are currently working with them to design the full 56 channel fixture.Software:A variety of software for data analysis is maintained and supported by the Core. These include proprietary CTF code, beamformer source reconstruction software (the SAM suite) written in-house, and MNE-python. We also provide support for non-MEG specific software packages that these programs interface with, such as FreeSurfer and AFNI. In addition, the MEG Core Facility frequently writes custom scripts to integrate stimulus and response data with the MEG dataset.To supplement the SAM software suite, the MEG Core Facility has begun writing a modularized set of python scripts to automate all states of MEG data pre-processing and analysis. Due to the modular nature of these scripts, they can rapidly be customized for new studies. The MEG Core Facility has been implementing these scripts using data acquired as part of the NIMH research volunteer study (NCT03304665) and will begin working with individual Core Facility users to automate their analyses. These scripts are also being expanded to be deployed broadly across the MEG community as part of the ENIGMA project, as detailed below.The MEG Core facility continues to assist investigators in setting up MEG software and ensures that all software is available on shared resources (The NIH High Performance Computing (HPC) center).Education and Training:As noted earlier, the field of MEG is relatively small compared to the MRI community, and there are fewer well-established methods. The analysis of complex tasks designed to test innovative hypotheses requires unique approaches. The MEG Core Facility staff can leverage its wealth of experience to support and train investigators on these tasks. One-on-one training and support are provided upon request, and accounts for a significant portion of the scientific staffs time. No formal courses have been held in the MEG Core Facility in FY20 due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, although we continue to offer one-on-one training.Support of the Larger MEG Community:Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we have temporarily suspended the MEG North America meeting and MEG Hackathon. As soon as it is feasible to run a meeting on the NIH campus with approximately 100 attendees, we intend to resume the meeting. To avoid overlap with the BioMag meeting, which has been delayed until fall of 2022, we anticipate holding an MEG North America meeting in the fall of 2023.As part of the NIMH protocol Recruitment and Characterization of Healthy Research Volunteers for NIMH Intramural studies (NCT03304665) we collected 68 recordings from healthy individuals on a comprehensive battery of cognitive tasks. These scans were part of a broader study collecting clinical, cognitive, and MRI data. We are currently in collaboration with the data science and sharing team to convert all data to the BIDS standard format, and we expect to have the full dataset shared on the NIH-supported OpenNeuro repository by the end of 2021.Our largest initiative in this domain has been the formation of the ENIGMA MEG working group. ENIGMA is a worldwide consortium of scientists in the domains of imaging and genomics. ENIGMA groups use meta-analysis or mega-analysis to understand how genotypes and neuroimaging phenotypes vary in health and a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders. We have recruited approximately 35 international MEG scientists to our working group. We are currently working with these groups to obtain data sharing permissions, and actively working on a processing pipeline for the data analysis.Scientific Contribution and Collaboration:The primary focus of the MEG Core Facility is to facilitate and enable the science of other NIMH investigators. However, based upon scientific interests, MEG Core Facility scientists frequently collaborate with other investigator to analyze data and test novel hypotheses. In FY20, core personnel continued to collaborate extensively with the labs of Carlos A. Zarate, Jr. (ETPB) and Karen F. Berman (CTNB) to gain insights into the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) and schizophrenia. Details regarding these collaborations are available in the attached project bibliography.The MEG core facility has recently completed a unique project to demonstrate the ability of MEG to record activity from deep sources in the brain, carried out under NIMH protocol NCT00397111. While many investigators still believe recording from deep/subcortical sources is not feasible, through the use of a system such as the CTF system with axial gradiometers, combined with beamforming techniques, recording signals from these sources is possible. A pilot study using both reward task (which robustly activates the basal ganglia), and a fine motor control task (which activates the cerebellum) has been completed. The reward task study has now been published, and the fine motor task manuscript is in preparation. Currently, the reward task is being used by Dr. Argyris Stringaris's group in a population of depressed adolescents. In addition, we are currently developing a real-time neurofeedback task using source-localized MEG to modulate activity in the amygdala. This will be a collaboration with Dr. Carlos Zarates group.The final scientific contribution of the MEG Core Facility is the support of the work of NIH intramural scientists.

MRS follows the same fundamental principles as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), except that MRS measures molecules other than water. Because it is noninvasive and nonradioactive (it has been called the noninvasive biopsy method), MRS can provide vital biochemical information about the living brain. It currently plays a critical role in expanding our understanding of brain neurochemistry and function. The MRS Core aims to: (1) provide technical support to existing MRS protocols to ensure the highest quality of data acquisition and analysis; (2) track and convey technical advances in the field; (3) develop and implement MRS techniques required to advance the research aims of NIH investigators.","As a noninvasive method for measuring the concentration and distribution of chemicals in the living brain, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is an important tool for studying brain function and disorders. However, acquiring robust measurement of MRS signals requires a sophisticated study design and the successful development, implementation and maintenance of various MRS techniques. As an active area for research, MRS technology attracts major efforts from top research centers around the world. Clinical magnetic resonance imaging scanners that are optimized for performing structural and functional imaging studies also present daunting obstacles for MRS technical development. Most MRS studies at NIH have been developed and implemented by the MRS Core under protocols 05-M-0144 (NCT00109174) and 11-M-0045 (NCT01266577).Over the last year we have continued to make progress in the following areas:1) Correction of baseline in short echo time proton MRS. Data acquisition at short echo time is needed to capture the entire metabolic profile of brain visible to proton MRS and to acquire, at the same time, the broad macromolecule baseline. The macromolecule baseline contributes to Cremer Rao Lower Bound of the metabolite signals. To quantify this effect accurately in clinical short echo time MRS, we developed and optimized a method, based on mean squared error of the baseline, for determining the smoothness of baseline. This advance has led to a more objective and reliable determination of metabolite signals (Zhang et al., Magn Reson Med, 72(4):913-22. 2014).2) Automatic correction of magnetic field inhomogeneity. It is essential to optimize the homogeneity of the magnetic field for all MRS experiments, because field inhomogeneity can easily destroy the critical separation of different chemicals. More importantly, an inhomogeneous field makes it difficult to suppress the tissue water signal effectively, making the reliable detection of more dilute chemicals impossible. This is particularly the case for anatomical regions of interest to psychiatric research. We have implemented and optimized an automatic shimming method that consistently out-performs the automatic shimming methods provided by MRI scanner manufacturers. This method has greatly improved the quality of clinical MRS data acquired at NIH. 3) Multi-slice chemical shift imaging of compounds containing N-acetylaspartate (NAA), creatine, and choline. The MRS core maintains a chemical shift imaging technique for mapping distribution of the neuronal marker N-acetylaspartate at 3 Tesla. This method simultaneously generates images of N-acetylaspartate (a prominent neuronal marker), creatine, and choline-containing compounds.4) Glutathione detection. Glutathione is a marker for oxidative stress. Many psychiatric and neurological disorders (such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and stroke) are associated with abnormal glutathione levels. In collaboration with Steven Warach (NINDS) a glutathione editing method was developed on the Philip 3 Tesla scanner at the Suburban Hospital for studying stroke patients using adaptive line-fitting. We have also developed a single-shot method for measuring glutathione at 7 Tesla (Lally et al., J Magn Reson Imaging 2016, 43(1):88-98).5) Carbon-13 MRS. Using carbon-13 labeled glucose or the glial-specific substrate acetate, it is possible to measure brain energetics and glutamate and glutamine cycling flux. Previously we invented a method for carbon-13 MRS by combining low power stochastic decoupling and intravenous infusion of glucose with a carbon-13 label at the C2 position. This strategy makes it possible to perform viable carbon-13 MRS on single channel clinical MRI scanners. Using this strategy, we have acquired high quality carbon-13 MRS data from both the occipital and frontal lobes of healthy participants and showed that it is feasible to detect, simultaneously, two labeling pathways in the human brain. More recently, we succeeded in implementing and optimizing this strategy on the 7 Tesla scanner with enhanced sensitivity and spectral resolution (Li et al, Magn Reson Med. 2016, 75(3):954-61), and we were the first to detect GABA turnover in the human brain. Using our 7 Tesla carbon-13 MRS method we have demonstrated, for the first time, that specific enzyme activities can be measured noninvasively in the human brain following administration of carbon-13 labeled glucose (Li et al, Sci Rep, 8:2328:1-8 (2018)).6) Proton glutamate editing. Previously we implemented a single-voxel glutamate editing method with correction of eddy current effects for measuring glutamate concentration at 3 Tesla. A method for simultaneously extracting both glutamate and glutamine from multi-echo MRS data has also been developed and implemented (Zhang et al, Magn Reson Med. 2016, 76(3):725-32). We have verified that, unlike the popular short-TE MRS, our multi-echo MRS has high resistance to errors originated from noise and linewidth variations across individuals because of its relatively flat baseline. Recently, we developed and optimized a new glutamate editing method that needs a single echo time to isolate the glutamate H4 signal at 7 Tesla.7) GABA and beta-hydroxybutyrate editing. Previously we implemented and refined a method for measuring GABA. As with N-acetylaspartate imaging, participants' movements can lead to difficulty in the accurate determination of GABA. We used a navigator strategy, based on residual water, to track and correct for participants' movement. We also developed special data processing software to correct for phase changes because of participants' motion. Improvements to these corrections have now been quantified and successfully applied in studies of human participants. We have quantified glutamate/glutamine concentration using GABA-edited spectral data at 3 Tesla. For measurement of GABA at 7 Tesla we have shown that combining spectral editing with shorter echo time (56 ms) and taking advantage of strong coupling effect GABA, together with glutamate, glutamine and glutathione can be measured at 7 Tesla with high precision (An et al, Magn Reson Med 2018, 80:1776-1786 doi: 10.1002/mrm.27172.). More recently, we have developed an editing technique for detecting beta-hydroxybutyrate and applied it to studying ketogenic diet treatment.8) NAAG editing. We developed MRS methods for measuring the dipeptide neurotransmitter N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG), which plays an important role in glutamatergic signaling. Our methods use regularized line-shape deconvolution, based on the L-curve method and Wiener filtering, to measure NAAG reliably (An et al, Magn Reson Med 2014, 72(4):903-912).9) 3 and 7 Tesla Phosphorus MRS imaging. We have developed a chemical shift imaging method for measuring phosphorus-containing chemicals in brain at 7 Tesla. The method has been successfully tested in both occipital lobe and frontal lobe. Brain phosphorus MRS at 3 Tesla has also been developed and applied to clinical studies. We have developed an internal standard to evaluate spectral fitting of 31P MRS spectra.10) Highly accelerated full density simulation of multispin systems for spatially localized MRS. Prior to our work, the state-of-the-art quantum mechanical simulation of multispin systems for generating basis function for spectral fitting may require prohibitively long computation time. We recently invented a vastly accelerated one dimensional simulation method that reduces computation time to minutes. As a result, highly accurate MRS basis spectra with high spatial digitization of MRS voxel can now be routinely used. Our method greatly improves of clinical proton MRS data and has already been adopted by many major MRS groups around the","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

The Neurophysiology Imaging Facility (NIF) is a research core facility that provides MRI services to a wide NIH research community studying the brain mechanisms in health and disease. The NIF facility offers services in two main categories. The first category is anatomical imaging: researchers now routinely obtain anatomical MRI scans of their subjects for example prior to any procedure. For example, such scans allow for the efficient guidance of electrodes to target structures of interest. Second, the facility makes functional MRI (fMRI)possible for a wide range of groups, effectively lowering the barriers for imaging. It is the latter of these two types of services that is most challenging and is the main focus of the NIF core. For the past 12 years, the core has focused its operation around a vertical 4.7T scanner. To meet the users' growing needs, an additional horizontal 3T scanner was delivered last year and is currently being adapted to the specialized needs of the NIF users. In addition to its service role, the NIF core pursues a few MRI-related research projects. These include those related to the origin of the blood-based functional MRI signal, the use of tractography based on diffusion MRI, and comparative fMRI across different mammalian brains. The NIF core was founded in 2004 under a joint initiative from NIMH, NINDS, and NEI to integrate neuroscience research broadly across the NIH.","Structural and functional imaging have become a central part of brain research, with scanning performed on several dozen scanners around the world. For a wide range of experiments, the 3D map of structures and/or activity patterns throughout the brain greatly aid research, including its efficiency and accuracy. The inherent connection with human MRI methods also makes many of the results obtained directly applicable and translatable to humans.The NIF facility at the NIH strives to make structural and functional imaging available and straightforward for laboratories on the NIH campus wishing to applying MRI methods. Thus one of our main goals is to lower the many conceptual and practical barriers involved in the scanning itself so that researchers can pursue combinatorial methods. Our staff assists in any of these scans, and further works to help scientists gain autonomy in conducting their own experiments, thus after a stint of research in the NIF facility many trainees know the basic principles of MRI and are able to operate the scanner.Functional MRI (fMRI) allows researchers to visualize activity patterns within the brain of an awake human or animal. This approach to neuroscience often involves mapping the responses for one type of sensory stimulus relative to that for another. There are many analytic steps between the acquisition of raw MR signals and the scientific interpretation of the measured neural signals. This is particularly true for functional MRI (fMRI), where activity maps are generated based upon the evaluation of time varying intensity values throughout the brain from a series of MR volumes. Most neuroscience researchers are not experts in the physics or engineering aspects of MRI and thus rely heavily on experts in these domains to develop and maintain the best scanning environment possible. Thus, MRI experiments are typically done in the context of a core imaging facility. In animal studies, the challenges of MRI are compounded by technical issues, such as the production of specialized radiofrequency (RF) coils and the need to obtain practical skills in surgery and animal training. Animal scanning is typically combined with other procedures such as pharmacological manipulation or simultaneous electrophysiological recording, often further complicating the imaging procedure. Overcoming these obstacles is of enormous value, since fMRI uniquely allows one to map activity over the entire brain and combine this method with other manipulations.This combination of a Siemens 3T scanner and a Bruker 4.7T scanner allow for a spectrum of different scanning possibilities for researchers at the NIH, ranging from routine anatomical scans to intricate, multimodal fMRI projects. These scanners serve all the NIH community and play an increasingly important role for biomedical and disease research. The new 3T scanner provides needed additional scanning time for our users and is serving to centralize much of the anatomical scanning for the community. It also provides a longer-term stability for the transition to replace the 4.7T vertical scanner with a cutting-edge system in the future. Six staff members including Dr. Leopold, each from a different scientific background and with different skills, aim to provide the most efficient functional scanning services possible for a broad range of investigators.Many users of the facility focus only on structural scanning, for which the staff takes over most of the procedure and the scientist provides information about the target sites and basic scanning requirements. This approach is widely used to identify electrophysiological target sites and the position of indwelling microelectrodes, and to evaluate the experimental precision of a brain manipulation such as an injection. One particularly valuable use of structural imaging is the direct comparison of electrical recording sites with foci of fMRI responses in the context of a cognitive task. There are a range of contrast options, including diffusion weighted scans that can identify features in the white matter, or provide the basis for tractography. We have also recently purchased a computerized tomography (CT) machine to reside in the facility, and to serve as part of a pipeline to further improve surgical accuracy for a wide range of users.For functional scanning, much of the work is done by scientists in individual laboratories, which the NIF staff train to become largely autonomous in their experiments. The Intramural Research Program at the NIH is one of the very few sites around the world in which monkeys can routinely participate in both fMRI and electrophysiological studies. The fMRI studies go beyond mapping functional specialization in the brain. Experiments within the facility typically combine fMRI with other procedures, such as microelectrode recordings or pharmacological inactivation, or cortical ablation. The fMRI experiments produce large data files that must be processed to evaluate the functional activity patterns across the brain. The facility provides storage of these data, guidance in the initial processing steps, and server machines for full data analysis.The NIF staff spends a relatively small fraction of its time carrying out research related to MRI itself. In the past several years, we have focused on completing studies related to diffusion tractography. We have been working in a highly collaborative effort with other groups inside and outside the NIH, we are continuing to study (1) the neuroanatomical basis of diffusion imaging, and (2) comparative fiber pathways across species. In addition, we have recently completed studies on the role of the basal forebrain in resting state spontaneous fMRI signals, as well as collaborative work involved in atlases, templates, and data sharing. At present, research in the facility is focused on the design and testing of implanted radiofrequency coils, with the hope that this method can become routine for users seeking to obtain higher signal-to-noise images. Other research lines in the facility involve the development of scanning with newly available contrast agents.","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

The causes of neuropsychiatric disorders have remained elusive. Attempts to attribute disease symptoms to patients' gene variants have been frustrating. Even when the correlations between a gene and a disease show good correlation, any cause and effect cannot be demonstrated with closer study. Genetic risk factors have been identified for only a handful of mental illnesses, and both the penetrance and the modulation of the effects of these genes vary. It is also difficult to trace a direct path from a gene to its function and from there to its role in neural circuitry. This is particularly true for disease that manifests as a functional regression (schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders, for instance).  Attributing symptoms to gene expression is especially elusive in these cases. The causes of mental health disorders are further obscured because they involve the basic processes of development; network connections and plasticity of the nervous system. Studying dysfunction in patients where the course of disease may span a lifetime and symptoms vary between individuals makes it necessary to use other research approaches to model human disease.Transgenic animal models have been used to show the link between many genes and the diseases they cause. Unfortunately, the complete and complex human range of human behaviors cannot be observed in animals. However, there are biochemical, electrophysiological, and simple behaviors that can reveal the role of genes in the development, adaptation, and function of the nervous system. The common features of all mammalian brains, including the conservation of significant genes, can be used to study neural system function. New technologies of genome manipulation in new species allow for opportunities to study the genetics of brain development, behavior and dysfunction that causes disease.","Summary 1) Production of rodent transgenicsMetrics of production over the past year include the following projects:a) 19 transgenic rodent projects produced by CRISPR constructs, with multiple lines produced for each project in rats (4) or mice (15).b) only 4 projects used legacy methods to make transgenic animals with plasmids or embryonic stem cells (ESC). 2) Cryopreservation, rederivation, and transfer of transgenic lines.a) 60 transgenic rodent lines have been archived by cryopreserving germ cells or embryos. b) 28 lines have been rederived, by transferring lines from pathogen-bearing animals into those with defined health status. c) over 2000 lines are maintained as frozen germ cells or embryos; duplicated in two locations, one on campus, one off campus to maintain resilience in emergency situations.3) Special Concerns during times of limited on-site researchIn this year as most researchers were separated from their usual laboratories and animal colonies, it became critical to preserve valuable research animal models. Without knowing when researchers could return to the laboratory, there was the danger of losing transgenic animal lines that had taken extensive resources to develop. For that reason, the core facility worked through this period of stasis to first preserve lines by cryopreservation and later to recover lines for renewed research. Sixty lines were cryopreserved. In an ongoing effort, at least 30 lines will be rederived before the end of the fiscal year as researchers have returned to their labs and re-establish their studies with transgenic animals.4) SARS-Cov2 a) Fibroblast cultures have been propagated using methods developed in the lab (see below) over several years. These cultures have proven useful as in vitro models of ACE2 expression. The ACE2 protein (which acts as a binding site for the SARS-CoV2 virus spike protein) has been introduced into cultured marmoset fibroblasts. Both the marmoset protein and the human protein have been expressed on these fibroblasts to compare the potential for viral infection. Currently, these cells are being immortalized to create reproducible testbeds to evaluate the binding of isolated viral spike protein by other investigators.b) Marmoset embryos grown in culture have been injected with CRISPR constructs that alter the ACE2 gene. Binding of the viral spike protein requires ACE2 protein domains. Two of these domains have been altered in cultured marmoset embryos. The frequency of targeting of the segments of the exons that encode these domains is being optimized. 5) Techniques for transgenic productiona) Rodents:  Over the last year, most of transgenic rodent lines that have been produced use CRISPR / cas9 nuclease technologies. Some transgenics have been generated using optimized CRISPR guides and homology arms to insert promoters and coding sequence into transcriptionally neutral genomic sites, such as the ROSA locus of mice and rats. Other transgenics have been produced by knocking in large regions of a gene to add recombination signals flanking coding exons in order to generate conditional knockouts. Another set of transgenics adds CRE or FLP recombinases to existing transcripts in order to maintain the fidelity of expression from endogenous transcriptional promoters. Only rarely does the core produce transgenics using legacy techniques such as plasmid- or ESC (embryonic stem cell)-mediated transgenic methods. b) Marmosets: Manipulating embryos to produce a line of transgenic marmosets is no longer a feasible option for most research. We have developed a more effective method of introducing transgenes into brain cells using AAV vector variants. These unique AAVs can be infused into the peripheral circulation, they avoid accumulating in the liver like most virus, but instead preferentially home to the brain. These viruses cross the blood brain barrier and migrate into the brain. These variants were developed in collaboration with the Gradinaru laboratory at Cal Tech where the variants were selected for our screening in the core. We have produced several animals that carry transgenes and express them in the brain. Further work is being completed to use this technology by intramural as well as neuroscientists around the world.  6) Genetic diversity and reproductive techniques for marmosetsMarmosets are endemic to eastern Brazil. Animals that are used for research breed well when housed in groups and furnished with enriched environments. The small numbers of marmosets that were used to initiate research colonies meant that inbreeding has become a problem. In order to increase the diversity of marmoset colonies, the core facility has been leading efforts to find animals that are genetically diverse and use assisted reproductive techniques (ART) to increase diversity in marmoset research colonies. a)	fibroblast production for archives and whole genome sequencing: techniques to isolate, purify and expand fibroblasts were optimized for marmoset skin biopsies. Those methods have been posted on the web site of the Marmoset Working Group, and are now being used by other labs including National Primate Centers. b)	Fibroblast cryopreservation from all our animals have provided a source of cultured cells that can be used for sequence analysis, induction of pluripotent stem cells or experiments such as those described above.c)	Immortalization of these cells, especially when used to express proteins that are expressed and post-translationally modified, provide a system that mimics in vivo function.d)	ART methods such as artificial insemination (AI) and in vitro fertilization (IVF) have been optimized and are used routinely in the core. e)	Sample preparation for AI or IVF has been used to simplify to promote the exchange of genetic diversity. Sperm samples from males that are genetically distinct can be easily collected and transferred to other colonies where AI or IVF can be used to create hybrid offspring. Samples can retain good progressive motility--the best indication of fertilityover 24 hours for shipping to any location. The cores tripartite mission statement continues to be to 1)  deliver transgenic animal models for neuroscience investigators at NIH, this has been accomplished in the last year by as described above. 2) The second directive is to provide other technical services, and in this year it has been the overwhelming role of the core to compensate for the difficulties investigators across the NIH have had with preserving, recovering and using animal models when many labs were working remotely. 3) And finally, in no other year has the core developed a single technology that will be so useful in manipulating brain genes and expression for neuroscience research in primates.  A panel of rats that express the CRE recombinase was generated in a collaboration with investigators at NIDA. Those lines continue to be distributed through the Rat Resource and Research Center. Other CRE-expressing lines will be distributed through RRRC once they are characterized. Mouse ESC (embryonic stem cell) lines that express the green fluorescent protein continue to be licensed.All new AAV vectors developed in and published) from the core facility will be available at Addgene.org","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

The projects requested from our investigators include the full spectrum of applications from the cellular level, such as custom microscope chambers and perfusion systems, to insect studies with fruit flies or locusts. In addition, we do various projects for research applications using rodents, primates and, of course, human, clinical-based research. To support this mission, our Section provides a staff of engineers and technicians to fabricate custom electronic, mechanical, and electromechanical devices and instruments. The unique arrangement of our group allows us to not only help the investigators that come to us directly, but to spend many hours each week helping in the individual labs to solve electrical noise and recording problems, consult on electrophysiological recording set-ups, and to make recommendations for custom or commercial equipment or software.To provide the support necessary for each of these areas requires a dedicated staff that, over time, becomes experienced in the specific research areas such as electrophysiology, radiochemistry, behavioral testing, fMRI, etc. As part of our goal, we therefore strive to have staff expertise in each of these various research areas. This expertise allows us to better understand the investigator's requests and to recommend the right technical solution as appropriate.  Due to the multitude of requests we encounter and the limited time to devote to each request, our engineering approach is one of integration before development.  If a commercially available system or sensor can be used, we will integrate or modify it into our design first.An additional goal for our Section is to keep abreast of new technologies as they become available and to integrate these new technologies into the research as needed. Application of new technologies in the area of Rapid Prototyping and 3D printing has saved many hours of design and construction time and provided a rapid turnaround for engineering and fabrication requests.","This past year, the Section on Instrumentation (SI) had the unique opportunity to support the research of various Labs & Sections within NIMH, NINDS, NICHD, and NCCIH. During the past twelve months, investigators from these labs and branches requested 236 formal projects from our staff. Each of these requests was documented and the time to complete the job was recorded. In addition to the formal requests, we are available daily for numerous walk-in, phone call or e-mail requests for assistance.In general, our technical support this past year can be divided into the following research areas:ElectrophysiologyThe Section on Instrumentation staff continuously strive to improve the utility of various components that comprise electrophysiology. We have continued to improve the engineering and fabrication of multiple-hole grid arrays that allow precise, repeatable placement of a single or multiple electrodes over a wide area. These arrays are also used for precise injection of chemicals to specific regions of the brain.  We have also continued to develop small single-electrode microdrives. Novel methods using 3D printing now allow for the production of low-component count yet accurate and smooth microdrives.fMRI/MRIThe Section on Instrumentation provides a wide range of support for fMRI-related research. Fabrication of devices for use in MRI environments is a specialized area of expertise, with great attention given to design without ferrous metals and minimization of all metal components. In addition, commercial industrial fiber optic components and systems are evaluated and integrated into many designs and devices we fabricate. SI supports the installation of new equipment in MRI suites, including custom mirror and projection assemblies used for stimulus presentation, and custom RF-shielded penetration panels used to route cabling.SI has devoted considerable resources to provide a solution for allowing accurate and precise monkey chair insertion and fixation in the 3T magnet for the Section on Cognitive Neurophysiology.   Non-Human Primate (NHP)Our group is responsible for providing a wide range of engineering and fabrication services to support non-human primate research. Many of the mechanical assemblies that are necessary for this type of research are engineered and fabricated in-house. Our group provides a diverse array of custom systems and components to many different investigators, such as custom primate chairs, high-strength restraints, MRI positioning systems, custom head coils, reward systems, data acquisition systems, analysis and optical response systems, as well as a wide range of small mechanical components. SI has responded to a continued increase in marmoset-based research by providing a variety of custom designed and fabricated marmoset testing systems, a wide variety of habitats, marmoset transport boxes, and marmoset reward systems.Human and ClinicalSI continues the development of a novel Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) system.  In collaboration with the Experimental Therapeutics & Pathophysiology Branch, the Section on Instrumentation is developing a multi-channel ECT system (iLAST). While modifications of ECT have improved its safety and tolerability, none of the currently used procedures individualize the current amplitude for each patient despite knowledge that anatomical variation significantly impacts the strength of the current delivered to the brain. iLAST introduces three areas of improvement over conventional ECT which is currently one of the most effective treatments available for treatment resistant depression but has residual side effects. 1) Conventional ECT uses two large disc electrodes that are spaced widely apart, which leads to a nonfocal electric field distribution in the brain. In iLAST, we use a multi-electrode array to selectively target regions of the brain similar to one employed in high-definition tDCS studies. 2) Conventional ECT uses a high and fixed current amplitude (800 mA). The fixed current amplitude is much higher than necessary to elicit an adequate seizure, and also results in individual differences in the amount of current entering the brain, possibly leading to variability in clinical outcome. In iLAST, we titrate the amplitude of the current for each patient. 3) Conventional ECT monitors seizure induction with two-channel EEG recording in the prefrontal cortex, which does not characterize seizure topography. In iLAST, we will use high-density EEG electrodes that are weaved into the multi-stimulation electrode array so that topographical ictal EEG is recorded.The ECT system is a multi-year collaboration, incorporating the development of a considerable amount of custom electronics and custom software development.  SI has completed the design of the individual channel boards and the main motherboard.  Considerable effort remains on software development and testing the system with high voltages and currents.BehavioralSeveral different types of mazes are used to study spatial learning and memory in rats. These studies have been used to help understand general principles about learning that can be applied to humans, and to determine how different treatments affect learning and memory in mice. We continue to produce a variety of custom T and Y mazes for behavioral testing. ImagingThe Section on Instrumentation continues to produce a variety of equipment that supports two-photon microscopy, such as novel titanium headposts and stereotaxic frames, faraday cages for electronic and light shielding and custom mirror mounts. In addition, behavioral testing equipment such as low-inertia mouse wheels are fabricated for use with two-photon microscopy.SI devoted a considerable amount of its effort this fiscal year in supporting the research of the Spatial Navigation and Memory Unit (NINDS); this research is primarily interested in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), which plays a key role in spatial representation and episodic memory. The MEC is a part of the medial temporal lobe and serves as the main gateway between the hippocampal formation and the neocortex. Dysfunction of the MEC is closely associated with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), the most common form of dementia. AD patients generally exhibit severe loss of episodic memory and have difficulty in spatial navigation.SI fabricated a testing system that allows a head-fixated mouse to navigate through a virtual reality system.  This system was initially developed by Princeton University, but it did not meet the requirements requested by the lead investigator.  The mouse is held directly over a nearly frictionless styrofoam ball inside of a spherical dome on which video images are projected. Optical sensors detect the movement of the ball and translate this to a moving image on the dome.  Auditory stimulation is provided by an array of speakers around the mouse, with a custom sound card and amplifier system that enables a sound to be output and moved seamlessly from any direction.   TechnologyBy using the latest technology in advanced fabrication machinery, we are able to increase productivity and effectiveness while at the same time decreasing the amount of time needed to engineer and machine components. We recently acquired a high-precision 3D printer that allows us to print plastics with different durometers.  Our waterjet cutter continues to increase our cutting and fabricating capabilities, especially with the multiple fiberglass parts we produce. The waterjet allows us to quickly fabricate systems that require many assembled pieces of flat stainless or polycarbonate, and to fabricate titanium headposts that are very difficult to machine with conventional tooling. Our Carbon Fiber 3D Printer allows us to print high strength complex organic shaped parts.",There were no publications during this reporting period,"[('Arash  Afraz, PhD, MD Unit on Neurons, Circuits and Behavior', 'Unit on Neurons, Circuits and Behavior'), ('Bruno B Averbeck, PhD Laboratory of Neuropsychology', 'Laboratory of Neuropsychology'), ('Peter A Bandettini, BS, PhD Section on Functional Imaging Methods', 'Section on Functional Imaging Methods'), ('Heather A Cameron, PhD Section on Neuroplasticity', 'Section on Neuroplasticity'), ('Yogita  Chudasama, PhD Rodent Behavioral Core', 'Rodent Behavioral Core'), ('Ellen  Condon Section on Neurocircuitry', 'Section on Neurocircuitry'), ('Zhi-De  Deng, PhD Experimental Therapeutics and Pathophysiology Branch', 'Experimental Therapeutics and Pathophysiology Branch'), ('Mark Eldridge, PhD Section on Neural Coding and Computation', 'Section on Neural Coding and Computation'), ('Amicia Devin Elliott Section on Neural Function', 'Section on Neural Function'), ('Rossella  Falcone Section on Neural Coding and Computation', 'Section on Neural Coding and Computation'), ('Jinsoo  Hong, MS, PhD Section on PET Radiopharmaceutical Sciences', 'Section on PET Radiopharmaceutical Sciences'), ('Jiemin  Jia, PhD Section on Synapse Development and Plasticity', 'Section on Synapse Development and Plasticity'), ('Camilla Rose-Marie Karlsson Section on Neuroplasticity', 'Section on Neuroplasticity'), ('Kenji  Koyano Section on Cognitive Neurophysiology and Imaging', 'Section on Cognitive Neurophysiology and Imaging'), ('Soohyun  Lee, PhD Unit on Functional Neural Circuits', 'Unit on Functional Neural Circuits'), ('David A Leopold, PhD Section on Cognitive Neurophysiology and Imaging', 'Section on Cognitive Neurophysiology and Imaging'), ('Shizhe Steve Li, PhD Magnetic Resonance Core', 'Magnetic Resonance Core'), ('sarah Hollingsworth Lisanby, MD Office of the Director', 'Office of the Director'), ('Andrew Rattin Mitz, PhD Section on Neurophysiology', 'Section on Neurophysiology'), ('Elisabeth Adams Murray, PhD Section on Neurobiology of Learning and Memory', 'Section on Neurobiology of Learning and Memory'), ('Mario Alexander Penzo, PhD Unit on the Neurobiology of Affective Memory', 'Unit on the Neurobiology of Affective Memory'), ('James M Pickel, PhD, AB Office of the Director', 'Office of the Director'), ('Victor W Pike, PhD Section on PET Radiopharmaceutical Sciences', 'Section on PET Radiopharmaceutical Sciences'), ('Dietmar  Plenz, PhD Section on Critical Brain Dynamics', 'Section on Critical Brain Dynamics'), ('Jia  Qi, PhD Unit on Functional Neural Circuits', 'Unit on Functional Neural Circuits'), ('Barry J Richmond, MD Section on Neural Coding and Computation', 'Section on Neural Coding and Computation'), ('Vinai  Roopchansingh, PhD Office of the Director', 'Office of the Director'), ('Richard C Saunders, PhD Section on Cognitive Neuroscience', 'Section on Cognitive Neuroscience'), ('Leslie G Ungerleider, PhD Laboratory of Brain and Cognition', 'Laboratory of Brain and Cognition'), ('Theodore B Usdin, MD Office of the Director', 'Office of the Director'), ('Benjamin H White, PhD Section on Neural Function', 'Section on Neural Function'), ('Ma  Xiaoyu Clinical and Translational Neuroscience Branch', 'Clinical and Translational Neuroscience Branch'), ('Walter Scott Young, MD, PhD, MPH Section on Neural Gene Expression', 'Section on Neural Gene Expression')]","George Raphael Dold, MS","Susan G Amara, PhD"

The RBC offers NIH researchers validated and reliable testing of mice and rats over a broad range of physiological and behavioral domains including general health, cognitive, emotional, sensory, and motor function. The goal of the RBC is to provide the necessary support to design and implement a behavioral study in rodents. This includes: 1) access to state-of-the-art rodent behavioral testing equipment and emerging technologies, 2) expertise and guidance in the planning, execution, and analysis of rodent behavioral research, and 3) an outstanding research environment that provides infrastructure, education and resources to foster collaborations between investigators and cores. These objectives implemented by the RBC have proven to stimulate multidisciplinary research and innovation in basic and translational neuroscience.","Behavioral neuroscience links systems-level circuitry to behavior, cognition and emotion and is thus critical for understanding the afflictions that affect neuropsychiatric patients. Linking cognitive changes in a behaving rat or mouse to targeted manipulations of neural circuitry requires the convergence of expertise from scientific fields inside and outside of neuroscience. In designing research projects to understand the anatomy, genetics, and pharmacology underlying the control of behavior, researchers must understand the nature of the task, its measurements, and how to interpret the data. Several steps lie between the design of the experiment and the behavioral output, including choice of task (e.g., operant vs mazes), how to train the animal (shaping vs conditioning), the type of surgical manipulation (ablation, cannulation, inactivation, stimulation, etc.), and the format of data for analysis (summary vs. trial-by-trial). Most neuroscience researchers who use standard off-the-shelf behavioral tasks are not experts in the psychology of behavior and must therefore rely on experts in the domain of cognition.Complex cognitive behavior in rodents is often gauged by measuring the pattern of behavioral responses in tasks that involve, for example, decision-making, attention, memory, rule learning, flexibility, discrimination, and problem solving. In these tasks, rats and mice typically indicate their decisions by nose-poking visual patterns on a touchscreen like an iPad, making nose-poke entries into a series of lit holes, or depressing an extended lever triggered by time or cues. Some cognitive functions extrapolated from animal behavior have positively informed our investigation of cognitive functions in humans. Such animal-to-human approaches (e.g., delayed response) have directed the design and development of analogous tests for use in humans (e.g., self-ordered working memory). Behavioral neuroscience has also benefitted in the opposite direction by means of human-to-animal approaches as in the case of extradimensionsal/intradimensional set shifting, a test based upon the principles of the human Wisconsin Card Sorting Task. Together, these advances in behavioral testing have been particularly useful in establishing the neuroanatomical and neurochemical pathology for specific cognitive deficits in a range of brain and behavior disorders.In addition to providing equipment, training and consulting for researchers interested in using rodents as models to investigate disorders of brain and behavior, one important goal for the rodent behavioral core (RBC) is to continue to design and develop cutting edge behavioral methods and applications while maintaining facility resources at a high level of utility for users at all levels of expertise. This requires constant maintenance and calibration of equipment, user education and interaction, and commitment to setting the standard as the best Rodent Behavioral Core facility in the world in terms of research quality.In the past year, the labs of several principal Investigators from NIMH, as well as NINDS, NIA, NIDCD, NHGRI, NICHD, NIDCD, NEI, and NHLBI have used the RBC to conduct behavioral studies in an efficient and targeted manner. Since opening in 2017, the labs of 51 principal investigators have used the RBC facility with over 100 trainees that have been trained by the RBC staff in some capacity to use specific resources in the Core. Over the past year, we custom designed and developed new tasks to measure various aspects of behavior including providing options for users to assess certain emotional behaviors such as defensive reactions that were more ethologically grounded. We have also instituted a mechanism to record ultrasonic vocalizations from groups of rodent families to measure social communication as an index of emotion. Virtually every piece of equipment in the RBC including operant chambers, mazes and open testing arenas can be is integrated with transistor-transistor logic (TTL) capability to interface with any TTL triggerable piece of equipment or software to enable optogenetic capability. The capability to conduct optogenetic studies in the RBC has made it an invaluable resource for many users who do not have the capability or resources to establish the infrastructure in their own labs. Most recently, we integrated methods of fiber photometry with spatial mazes, operant chambers, and tests of emotional memory to enable users the ability to obtain a more electrophysiological readout.  This required updating our operant control systems to enable liquid rewards as well as pellets. In addition, we implemented new LED arrays in operant boxes to provide dim light to measure vision detection thresholds. Finally, due to the high demand for rodent surgery, in the past year we upgraded the surgery suite with an additional Robotic stereotaxic frame to enable high throughout and precision microsurgical procedures. Together, these technical accomplishments have allowed users of the RBC to obtain an in-depth characterization of rodent behavior through modern, automated methods.In addition to providing equipment resources, we have written custom code for several users to enable detailed levels of behavioral quantification or analyses for their experiments. For example, general motor activity data is usually indexed as duration and location of activity. With custom code, weve been able to provide researchers with additional measures such as speed of activity as well as visual patterns of the movement. We have also started to integrate observed behavior with high-speed tracking using DeepLabCut, an open source code computer vision technique to accurately quantify behavior using a pose estimation of body parts. Its major advantage is that it allows the user to go directly from the data set creation to automatic behavioral analysis. It will also provide a means to standardize behavioral testing in an open-access manner so that data generated in the RBC can be shared between collaborators.In the past fiscal year, the scientific supported provided by the NIMH RBC has contributed to several peer reviewed articles published in: Journal of Neuroscience (Jiang et al), International Journal of Molecular Science (Do et al), Cell Reports (Naskar et al; Sathyamurthy et al), Journal of Visual Experiments (Landeck et al), Journal of Parkinsons Disease (Mazza et al), BioRxiv (Mamais et al), Nature (Fernandez et al), Nature Neuroscience (Ma et al) and Communications Biology (Pathak et al).","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

This includes:- Standardized, community recognized formats and repositories for data storage and dissemination- Collaborative, version-controlled tools for developing analysis code- Open distribution of all experimental methods and results to maximize impact and reproducibility","For our fifth annual report we have provided some highlights of our team's activities over the past fiscal year.Data SharingOur team continues to collaborate with Joyce Chung and the NIMH Clinical Director's Office on the Healthy Research Volunteers Protocol (NCT03304665). Phenotypic data for 1,358 participants have been deposited into the OpenNeuro data repository (https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds003504) using the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) standard. 149 of these subjects also have standardized MRI scans and 63 have MEG scans. These data will be made publicly available once the associated data paper has been accepted for publication.DSST staff have also provided assistance in making data sets standard compliant and publicly available for Audrey Thurm's and Ben White's groups.Data CurationWith the continued growth of large public datasets, data curation/management continues to be our team's most requested service.  To manage these demands, we have brought new pools of storage online including one petabyte of shared solid-state disk (SSD) space on the NIH High Performance Compute Cluster (HPC) which is available to all NIMH intramural researchers. Here we provide access to over 100,000 MRI-based scan sessions across 31 different shared datasets. We maintain a comprehensive list of these datasets on our website (http://cmn.nimh.nih.gov/dsst).In collaboration with Dr. Armin Raznahan's group, we are also now curating Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) datasets from the NHGRI Genomic Data Science Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-space (AnVIL). This 100 TB dataset is now accessible from the NIH HPC available for use by the wider NIMH intramural program.TrainingThe DSST is continually providing ad hoc training consulting with researchers and trainees throughout the NIH intramural program, however three more structured training offerings are detailed below:-	Three of our staff (Dustin Moraczewski, Jessica Dafflon, and Arshitha Basavaraj) participated in the ABCD ReproNim (https://www.abcd-repronim.org) as both teaching assistants and high-level students who could provide guidance and mentorship to more junior researchers. The course had over 100 students enrolled from around the world. The course provides detailed instruction on reproducible methods, gold-standard, NIH-funded share data (ABCD), and larger principles of Open Science.-	In July, Eric Earl served as an instructor for NeuroHackademy (https://neurohackademy.org) a selective and highly respected training course that is now in its fifth year.  Graduates of Neurohackademy frequently go on to become leaders in the reproducible neuroscience community.-	In August, Adam Thomas led a team at the NIH Summer Internship Programs Codeathon where trainees at various levels learned and practiced data science and reproducible computing.Preregistered ReplicationStarting in September of 2019, our team mentored a one-year post baccalaureate student, Nik Goyal, who submitted a paper to the Royal Society of Open Science on their preregistered replication track. In this publication model, only the study design and methods are peer reviewed before acceptance. If the design and methods are sound, the publication of the study is ensured regardless of the results. This model combats publication bias by ensuring that negative results are published. Nik's submission was enthusiastically accepted and the analysis demonstrating the finding is indeed reproducible in an independent dataset has been completed.  It is now under final review for compliance with the pre-registration which is available on the Open Science Framework (OSF) repository (https://osf.io/8ctqz).Data standards and sharing for Positron Emission Tomography (PET)In collaboration with Dr. Bob Innis, our team is working to advance and encourage data sharing in the PET community. This has entailed the creation of standard nomenclature, a new BIDS specification for formatting and sharing PET data, and a new public repository for sharing standard-compliant data. For more details on this project, see the NIMH annual report entitled OpenNeuroPET.CollaborationsThe DSST continues to collaborate with investigators on projects and publications that involve large shared datasets. In the past year, these collaborations have included multiple projects with our sister group, the Machine Learning Team (MLT). As applying machine learning methods to answer neuroscientific questions has become more prevalent, we seek to improve interpretability when applying deep neural networks to predict brain state. See our preprint for more information: https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11114. In another project with the MLT, we aim to leverage information across multiple large datasets to improve upon individual phenotypic prediction models utilizing multiple imaging modalities.In our collaboration with fellow IRP researcher Arman Raznahan and the Section on Developmental Neurogenomics, we assisted with processing the structural brain images from almost 40,000 subjects within the UK BioBank dataset in order to examine how variations in the X-chromosome relates to neuroanatomical variability. This work was recently published in Nature Neuroscience (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-021-00890-w).COVID-19Our work on COVID-19 survey data continues in collaboration with Drs. Francisco Pereira, Joyce Chung, and Melissa Brotman. Carl Harris, who has recently joined our group as a post bac intramural trainee has taken the lead on this project. He has made substantial progress with machine learning models designed to predict longitudinal outcomes using kernel regression techniques.  Data collection and analyses are ongoing.","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

Our work is accomplished through collaborations with investigators in both the NIH intramural and extramural programs. We provide in-depth behavioral phenotyping of specific genetic conditions associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, setting the stage for genotype-phenotype investigations to be conducted. One goal of the research is to provide neurodevelopmental characterization of individuals across the spectrum of cognitive and social functioning. Another goal is to use samples with rare conditions that include severe and profound intellectual disability to validate existing measures and test newly standardized measures amenable to tracking developmental progress. An objective of this goal is to pinpoint the functional-biomarker relationships that may one day inform treatment trials. We also test these measures directly in treatment trials.  To meet these goals, the service conducts studies and collaborates with investigators both within and outside NIH. The work of the service contributes to the mission of the NIMH to reduce the burden of mental illness, since our assessments are part of comprehensive phenotyping conducted in NIH studies, and allows for diagnoses to be made and refined. Our work contributes to multi-disciplinary clinical research as well as translational research on brain-based and multisystem childhood-onset medical and mental conditions.","The Neurodevelopmental and Behavioral Phenotyping Service provides a resource to the NIH Clinical Center, as well as to specific NIH research projects, by conducting neurodevelopmental assessments on participants enrolled in NIH research protocols. Assessments provide data on a variety of rare genetic conditions associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, such as  Intellectual Disability and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The service enrolls patients into a protocol that includes behavioral assessments (NCT00271622) and a collaborative protocol that provides assessment of specific rare genetic conditions (NCT02461420), which includes an additional focus on studying adults with such conditions as well as children (NCT03426059). In addition, we participate in several other studies that are conducting behavioral phenotyping of conditions that have yet to have their natural histories fully explored. These characterization studies are necessary for understanding the breadth and depth of syndromes that cause lifelong impairments, based on developmental delays that often lead to Intellectual Disability and Autism Spectrum Disorder . We also continue to be involved in treatment studies, including those testing novel therapeutic agents and gene therapy in ultra-rare genetic conditions.Related to these efforts, we seek to take advantage of gains made in identification of genetic abnormalities in those already diagnosed with ASD or Intellectual Disability, by exploring whether genotypic differences may be reflected in behavioral phenotype differences among children diagnosed with these conditions. Our explorations of data previously collected through the NIMH intramural research program, as well as from several large-scale repositories and epidemiologic studies continue to produce novel findings about the onset and longitudinal course of neurodevelopmental disorders. We have  focused on developmental milestone attainment differences in subpopulations, finding specific early delays are important markers for predicting genetic abnormalities in children who go on to have established neurodevelopmental diagnoses.We have continued our efforts to better describe the differentiation or additive effects of Intellectual Disability and ASD profiles within rare genetic conditions, given the implications of these diagnoses on lifelong disability and the need for potential treatment targets and appropriate outcome measures. Our collection of data is building on the work of research on existing standardized autism diagnostic instruments by analyzing data on how these measures function over time, and on how measurements differ within specific genetic disorders. We are also testing out newly updated versions of tests with different psychometric properties, to analyze their more fine-grained data for the detection of potential changes in skills over time. We also recognize that our psychometric work may be synergistic with the search for biomarkers, which hold great promise for intervention research. Thus, we have integrated into our research program several studies of putative biomarkers, with modalities including electrophysiology and neuroimaging.The potential for a better understanding of psychiatric disorders by fuller descriptions of specific behavioral phenotypes has never been greater. However, rare genetic conditions are overly represented among individuals with developmental disabilities, and intellectual/developmental disability is the predominant phenotype for the majority of the individuals evaluated through the service. While there are many available tools for many components of the phenotype in which we are interested, such as cognitive and social-communication skills, they are often not appropriate for use in the populations studied. Thus, our ability to describe the phenotype of these disorders is limited by the precision and validity with which we are able to measure the constituent behaviors. We recognize our responsibility to rectify this urgent unmet need.We have worked on these longstanding measurement concerns in both theoretical and applied ways. Leveraging our access to samples of interest, we have produced several rigorous psychometric evaluations of common measures. We select these measures based not only on their wide-spread use, but also on clinical experiences which suggest they may be flawed, and on their potential for use as outcome measures in clinical trials. Such work has included studies of measures in populations not represented in validation samples and of non-standardized usage of existing measures. For instance, impairment in adaptive behavior is a criterion for diagnosis of intellectual disability in both the DSM and ICD systems, reflecting its usefulness in quantifying individual functioning. As such, adaptive behavior is increasingly an outcome of interest in the study of neurodevelopmental disabilities. We have engaged in extensive theoretical and empirical investigation of the psychometric properties of person-ability scores, a metric used in specific measures, which may be especially useful as an outcome measure in clinical trials aiming to show maximal sensitivity to potential changes in skill development. Another area of methodologic and theoretical focus for our group is the differentiation of intellectual disability and ASD, an issue that has plagued the field since ASD was first described. This occurs because some symptoms of ASD  social and communication skills which are less developed than peers  are also observed in intellectual disability. In intellectual disability the impaired skills are commensurate with the overall developmental level, whereas in ASD they are a relative weakness, so differentiation depends wholly on thorough assessment and a nuanced understanding of the presentation of ASD in the context of intellectual disability. The range of samples to which we have access, from those ascertained due to risk or diagnosis of idiopathic ASD to those enrolled with extremely rare multi-systemic genetic conditions that greatly impact the CNS, affords us a special ability to produce both conceptual and practical contributions to this work. We have produced or been involved with a number of projects illustrating the impact of intellectual disability on the measurement of ASD symptoms as well as general evaluations of the psychometric properties of common ASD diagnostic instruments in intellectual disability.In addition to improving uses of existing measures, we also engage in measurement development, including the use of innovative modalities. This is especially important since many of the research participants we evaluate are not able to obtain a standard score on a cognitive measure normed for their age range, due to the severity of their cognitive impairments Many also have ancillary motor or receptive language impairments that make traditional cognitive tests challenging beyond their cognitive impairment. We have evaluated novel measures, such as the tablet-based NIH Toolbox Cognitive Battery, a set of tasks initially developed for use in normative populations. We have piloted this measure on specific groups -to provide data on performance in populations with intellectual disability. We also directly collaborate on a test for inclusion in a new version of this tool intended for infants and toddlers. This new subtest taps into concept formation, a critical prerequisite skill that has been studied extensively as a precursor to what is commonly described as nonverbal intelligence.Finally, since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have contributed to several ongoing studies examining the effects of COVID-19 and the pandemic itself on childrens neurodevelopment, including an NIH intramural study, by providing guidance on inclusion of measures for neurodevelopmental outcomes.","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

The ultimate goal of the research component of this service is to work collaboratively with scientists inside and outside of the NIH to help identify electrical activity patterns in the sleeping brain and other physiological markers of sleep  that might predispose individuals to neurodevelopmental disability or mental illness. If we can identify these patterns, we can work together to identify therapeutic targets.","This past year we saw fewer patients due to COVID-19 and the Sleep and Neurodevelopmental Service scheduled 71 studies across 9 institutes. We have collected sleep data on several distinct cohorts including children with childhood onset schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder, autism, McCune Albright Syndrome, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Sickle Cell Disease, Neurofibromatosis, as well as for people with various disorders of neurodevelopment with both known and unknown genetic causes. We are working with our collaborators to try to identify unique sleep signals that help define the disorders under study and therefore outline paths for potential therapeutic intervention.  Some of our earliest work, looking at sleep in children with autism, helped us understand that there is a lot of information in the way the brain sleeps and that sleep neurophysiology also contains important information about the way the brain matures. We recently published our findings showing that in a large cohort of children with autism, sleep markers, called spindles, were reduced compared to children with typical development and also reduced when compared to children with developmental delays who did not also have autism. This work suggests that some markers only found in sleep, might be related to behavioral differences in children. These findings highlight the importance of looking at the sleeping brain during development for some of the earliest clues regarding neurodevelopmental disorders. Yet, considerable gaps in knowledge still exist in our understanding of sleep measurements and how these change during the early periods of brain development. Filling in these gaps may aid in the earliest identification of mental health disorders. We work closely with the Neurodevelopmental and Behavioral Phenotyping Service to best associate changes in the sleeping brain to neurodevelopmental stages in typical and atypical neurodevelopment. A major focus of the research arm of the Service is to develop a comprehensive battery of sleep measurements as a mainstay of clinical assessment of children at risk for neurodevelopmental disorders. Through our efforts with researchers from many different disciplines, we hope to create and initiate standardized protocols for collecting sleep data on children. The online summary of our efforts to promote Electrophysiologic Sleep Phenotyping (ESP) as a mainstay of the clinical assessment of children at risk for neurodevelopmental disorders can be found at the following link: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/news/events/2017/sleep-and-neurodevelopment-workshop-electrophysiologic-sleep-phenotyping-esp.shtml. The prospective longitudinal ESP evaluation, including comprehensive behavioral assessment of children with typical development and those at risk for neuropsychiatric or neurodevelopmental disorders, opened recruitment in the summer of 2021. We will use electrical sleep patterns recorded from the brain to help identify normal and abnormal neurodevelopmental trajectories at the earliest possible opportunity in order to help us develop comprehensive treatment strategies.

The NIMH Systems Neuroscience Imaging Resource (SNIR) makes contemporary tools for systems level molecular anatomy accessible to investigators. The SNIR supports investigation of circuits in the mouse and other species. This includes the implementation of advances in molecular anatomical methods in the marmoset and macaque. Facilitation of work incorporating advances in 3D reconstruction of specified circuits, and the distribution of cell types, specific proteins and mRNAs, combining clearing, image acquisition, and volume reconstruction methods is a focus.The SNIR provides access to hardware, software, wet lab procedures, training, support and expertise surrounding histological preparation and microscopy. The SNIR facilitates access to well established technologies such as high-throughput wide-field microscopy and laser scanning confocal microscopy, as well as developing technologies such as light sheet microscopy. It will also facilitate the application of recently developed genetic, molecular, imaging, and analysis techniques to the projects and problems of intramural investigators. Implementation of tissue clearing approaches is a focus.Interactions between users and the SNIR vary widely, based on project requirements and investigator expertise. Some investigators will have well developed procedures and simply need to use equipment. Orientation to specific equipment and time allocation will be provided.

This is its fifth year of operation. SNIR functions can be divided into three interacting domains: acquisition and maintenance of equipment and software, development and implementation of procedures, and training. The COVID-19 pandemic had a major effect on its operation, but many activities continued. Image processing resources, in particular, were made available through remote access. With partial return to the workplace, procedures were put in place for safe use of equipment. Essentially all requests for use of equipment were accommodated.Major supported equipment includes: 1) Zeiss AxioscanZ1 slide scanning microscope (2016 acquisition). This is a high quality widefield microscope with transmitted brightfield and fluorescent epi-illumination capacity. Its most significant feature is the ability to program multichannel tiled acquisition of large areas from up to 100 microscope slides. It is being actively used by investigators from 10 different intramural laboratories for projects that include whole brain mapping of gene expression profiles and the projections of genetically tagged and fluorescently labeled neuron populations. The system was used to capacity until campus occupancy was reduced because of COVID-19. Use ramped up quickly with the phased return to campus. Procedures for remote interactions with a technician who handles physical interactions with the instrument were established. 2) Zeiss LSM780 microscope (2011 acquisition, now a secondary instrument). This is a high quality inverted confocal microscope with 405, 488, 514, 561, 594 and 633 nm lasers, a 32-channel GaAsP based spectral detector and 2 conventional PMTs. 3) LaVision Ultrascope (2017 acquisition). This is a light sheet microscope optimized for low magnification (1.2 to 12X 0.5 NA objective with a minimum light sheet thickness minimum of 5 microns) imaging of large samples (up to approximately 10 x 10 x 6 mm). It has 405, 488, 552, 638, and 740 nm lasers. Whole mouse brains immunolabeled with the iDISCO technique are being imaged routinely and projects using brains cleared with CUBIC, SHIELD and other procedures are under development. 4) Leica SP8 confocal/multiphoton system (2017 acquisition). This is an upright microscope equipped with long working distance dipping objectives designed for work with thick cleared samples. It is equipped with 405, 488, 552 and 638 nm fixed lasers and an Insight X3 tunable IR laser, and both internal, and external non-descanned, PMT and HyD detectors. It has capacity to perform fluorescent lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). 5) Nikon A1HR confocal system (2020 acquisition).

In parallel, we are a machine learning research group, working on new methods and analysis approaches, motivated by the needs of researchers or by the practical possibilities arising from advances in the field.","This is the fourth annual report for the Machine Learning Team. The team comprised Francisco Pereira, Charles Zheng, Patrick McClure, Ka Chun Lam  all research scientists -- and Yenho Chen (postbac IRTA) until November 2020 and January 2021, when Sebastian Bruch and Juan Antonio Lossio Ventura, respectively, joined the team. Sebastian Bruch and Yenho Chen left the team at the end of July 2021, and Nicole Kuznetsov became our new postbac IRTA in August 2021. We work very closely with the Data Science and Sharing Team (DSST), both on specific joint projects and informally across many others.Research activity:We continued research projects initiated in the previous year. These were the projects that led to a published article :1) Martin Hebart and Chris Baker - Discover interpretable mental representations of objects from a large database of behavioral judgements, which can be used to predict human behavior on a variety of other tasks2) Hanna Keren and Argyris Stringaris - Develop models to predict mood during a gambling task, based on participant characteristics, trial parameters, and experiment history. This project was extended to incorporate different model types, and new kinds of behavioral experiment.3) Ana Inacio and Soohyun Lee - Determine whether the pattern of synaptic weights of four different GABAergic neuron types carries enough information to identify the input region (as part of a study of functional heterogeneity of principal neurons in layer II/III of sensory cortex)4) Maryam Vaziri-Pashkam - Develop a method to produce interpretable representations of objects in terms of their affordances (action verbs that apply to them), grouping verbs into high-level modes of interaction, based on information extracted from text corpora. Several other projects led to submissions currently under review (or preparation):1) Xiaoyu Ma and Zheng Li - Develop an approach for testing whether the encoding of information by prefrontal cortex neurons changes between experimental conditions, subject to confounding factors.2) Adi Cymerblit-Sabba and Scott Young - Prediction of various experimental parameters from calcium imaging data in social and object habituation experiments, to test whether certain neural populations contain that information.3) MLT + DSST - Develop a new method for extracting brain maps from a deep neural network trained to decode which task is being performed by a subject. The maps show where the information used by the network is present. The article introduces two different quantitative evaluation procedures for gauging the quality of the maps and compares our method with existing ones.4) Dave Jangraw and Argyris Stringaris  Help analyze data from many different experiments, imaging and behavioral, to show that rest periods lower the mood of participants, an effect we call resting-state dysphoria5) Jingfeng Zhou and Geoff Schoenbaum  Demonstrate that deep reinforcement learning can be used to produce a model of an agent performing a task, given only the same reward schedule and stimuli as an experimental subject. Validate that agent against neural data of a subject performing the same task.6) Martin Hebart (now an external collaborator) and Chris Baker  Develop an improved version of the method for extracting interpretable representations from behavior, using approximate Bayesian inference, which should perform better in smaller datasets (such as those collected by other groups in the IRP).7) Joyce Chung and the COVID-19 survey group  Develop a predictor of mental health status for participants, based on data from the subsample of participants that had also participated in prior NIH studies. This was used as part of an analysis to relate predicted mental health status to clinical symptoms and pandemic-related psychological and behavioral responses during lockdown. We also developed automated methods to quantify the emotional valence of free text produced by participants, as well as produce summaries of the main topics present in such text across time.In addition to these projects, we have ongoing research or service projects with researchers in the groups of Drs. Raznahan, Stringaris, Lee, Zarate, Pine, Baker, Conway, Martin, Atlas, Averbeck, and  Bandettini, at NIMH, and Hope, at NIDA, none of which have yet led to submitted papers. Some of these have consumed months of person-effort, as we try to mix high-risk/high-impact projects with those satisfying specific needs of the PIs.We would like to highlight the main project we worked on in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the work above, we are now developing methods to predict changes in a variety of psychiatric and behavioral outcomes, as a function of personal and environmental circumstances. The goal of this project is to identify the participant characteristics that help with resilience to pandemic stressors (or, conversely, worsen their effect).The pandemic delayed the hiring of some personnel on our team and DSST. This, in turn, forced us to delay a joint IRP-funded project with the goal of building re-usable deep neural network components (DNN) for many different feature types derived from MR imaging modalities. We were able to go back to the project in earnest in January of 2021, and carry out the first stage of our plan. This entailed developing a processing pipeline for dataset projects, as well as processing several large, public imaging datasets totaling almost 40,000 subjects. We also began developing our first DNN components, and preliminary trials indicate that they can be re-used successfully in small clinical datasets.Finally, we have a number of internal projects for developing new methods which, if they prove effective, we will bring to the attention of PIs who might have an application for them. Consultation/Service activityWe carried out ad-hoc consultations on machine learning methods (which can take hours to days, if they require reading articles or finding/testing code), or  co-advising of postbac and postdoc trainees (days-weeks. In addition to the PIs mentioned above, we provided consulting to people in the groups of Drs. Bandettini, Baker, Stringaris, Raznahan, Cox, Ungerleider, Li, Averbeck, Atlas, Pine,  Lee, Conway, Martin, Zarate, Chung, Leibenluft, Brotman, Schmidt, Tejeda, and MacMahon, as well as Schoenbaum, Hope, and Lin (NIDA), and Horovitz, Johnson, and Nath (NINDS).Due to the pandemic and increased demand for data analysis and consulting, we reduced software development efforts. We have released our software to segment human faces and body parts in visual stimuli (e.g. photos or video frames), to go with published paper that used it. For more details, please see:A Deep Neural Network Tool for Automatic Segmentation of Human Body Parts in Natural Sceneshttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.09900Education, Training, and PresentationsGiven the general fatigue with videoconferencing, and poor attendance at talks, we suspended the Machine Learning in Brain Imaging, Neuroscience and Psychology seminar, in collaboration with Javier Gomez-Castillo.We gave a presentation on our paper Mental representations of objects reflect the ways in which we interact with them at the annual meeting of the Cognitive Science Society. We also gave invited presentations at New York University, Carnegie Mellon University, Bowdoin College, and Williams College.","Ordered by publication type and then author name.

The NIMH Office of the Clinical Director (OCD) assists the Scientific Director (SD) in the planning and implementation of new scientific directions within the NIMH IRP with searches for clinical tenured and tenure-track faculty undertaken this year. While providing critical clinical research infrastructure to NIMH investigators, the OCD also serves as an important liaison to the NIH Clinical Center (CC) and the NIH community at large through administrative advocacy of NIMH priorities and by providing mental health expertise and services to the CC and the NIH campus. In 2021, the OCD provided significant clinical and administrative support to the SD and the NIH CC in response to establishing patient and staff safety practices while conducting research in the face of the evolving COVID-19 pandemic at NIH. The mission of the OCD is to support and maintain a complex dynamic clinical research enterprise. This is accomplished through OCD oversight of many administrative, clinical and training activities through the Human Subjects Protections Unit (HSPU), the Marketing and Recruitment Unit, the Patient Safety and Quality Team, Clinical and Regulatory Oversight Team, Clinical Training programs (see OCD annual report ZIE MH 002939-09), Credentialing, and the Psychiatry Consultation Liaison Service (PCLS). In addition, the clinicians within the OCD conduct research that supports the NIMH mission and priorities.","CLINICAL RESEARCH SUPPORT SERVICES: A central mission of the OCD is to ensure that research participants receive the highest quality clinical care. The OCD is responsible for oversight of all clinical aspects of the NIMH Intramural Research Program (NIMH IRP). New clinical trials and implementation of initiatives such as whole genome sequencing of all NIMH inpatients and a program to study autoimmune brain disorders were launched in FY2021. The OCD participated in a routine mandatory administrative review of the Scientific Director's Office by an external committee with positive results.CLINICAL OVERSIGHT: The OCD team meets regularly with NIH Clinical Center (CC) medical and nursing leadership to review CC census, discuss clinical concerns and plan for future initiatives. The monthly Patient Safety Quality meeting is also a forum for communication of hospital-related policies and regulations and continued to meet monthly, virtually, during pandemic maximum teleworking status. The OCD team coordinated the hospital-wide implementation of suicide risk screening at the CC in response to a Joint Commission Sentinel Event Alert 56 calling for suicide risk screening of all medical patients in the hospital setting and participated in validation of suicide risk screening tools in patients across the lifespan (see ZIA MH002922-13). The OCD is responsible for credentialing through reviewing the qualifications of all clinical personnel and is involved in maintaining the clinical competence of all NIMH health care professionals. As the link between the CC hospital and the Institute, the OCD is responsible for the implementation of CC policies and standard operating procedures (SOPs). The OCD participates in annual CC budget planning meetings and coordinates hospital initiatives such as preparation for Joint Commission accreditation visits, annual flu shot compliance, Physician Wellbeing programs etc.PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY (PSQ): In 2016, the OCD established the Office of Patient Safety and Quality to oversee NIMH quality improvement initiatives by each branch/section/lab chief and manager with a dual focus of improving and ensuring quality clinical care, and sharing their experiences with the larger NIMH intramural clinical care group during monthly PSQ meetings. The OCD also tracks and trends Clinical Center occurrences and ensures follow-up. The OCD has representatives on the Clinical Center (CC) safety and quality initiatives, including daily patient safety huddles, the hospital-wide Clinical Care and Quality meeting, and the Patient Safety Clinical Practice and Quality Committee. NIMH monthly safety meetings for basic science labs are also attended by an OCD representative. Each branch/lab/section has presented at least one PSQ project and are scheduled to present follow up findings for their ongoing continuous quality improvement projects. HUMAN SUBJECT PROTECTIONS: The mission of the Human Subject Protections Unit (HSPU) is to ensure the protection of potentially vulnerable subjects participating in research and to educate researchers and participants. This team works with investigators, the Institutional Review Board (IRB), and the CC Bioethics Department to identify and ameliorate risks for vulnerable subjects. Responsibilities include: 1) Consent and Assent Monitoring, 2) Subject Monitoring of all NIMH inpatients, 3) Capacity Assessment-for select high-risk studies, 4) Ability to Appoint an NIH Advanced Directive/Durable Power of Attorney (DPA) Assessment, 5) Appropriateness of the Surrogate Assessment, and 6) Training and Education. The HSPU developed and conducts the ""Elements of a Successful Consent"", a required training for investigators obtaining informed consent. To date, 1826 NIH staff have completed this training. The HSPU launched the NIMH Toolkit for Human Subjects Protections available at https://www.nimh.nih.gov/hspu to assist other research organizations to assess, develop and implement appropriate levels of human subjects protections at their own facilities. HSPU assessments and trainings have been provided via telehealth and virtually as needed in response to COVID-19. SCIENTIFIC REVIEW: The Committee for Scientific Review of Protocols (CSRP) reviews all new clinical protocols. Nine new protocols were approved in 2021, with 4 in process as of this writing. A subcommittee conducts annual review of ongoing protocols. REGULATORY OVERSIGHT: The Office for Regulatory Oversight (ORO) focuses on compliance with regulatory requirements and Good Clinical Practice (GCP). The NIMH Clinical Director now serves as the IND (10 active, 1 pending)/IDE (2 approved) sponsor with support from the Office of Research Support and Compliance (ORSC) via quarterly meetings. The ORO coordinates the scientific review of new and ongoing protocols and provides protocol navigation services to investigators. The navigation team provides direct support to investigators in all aspects of IRB submissions and tracking of investigator trainings. The OCD and SD have implemented genetic data sharing and data sharing plans for intramural studies in accordance with NIH policy. The OCD coordinates a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) to oversee NIMH IRP protocols. Two clinical monitors develop and implement individualized monitoring plans for all active NIMH IRP protocols. This team also provides training and develops corrective action plans as needed. TRAINING AND EDUCATION: The NIMH OCD works in partnership with the NIMH Office of Fellowship Training (OFT) and the Office of Clinical Research and Training in Medical Education (OCRTME) to oversee and participate in several programs that train and educate new physicians and medical students. In addition, the NIMH OCD contributes to initiatives that identify and promote academic research careers among promising early career psychiatrists. See OCD Training report ZIE-MH002939-09 for details. CONSULTATION SERVICES: The NIMH Psychiatry Consultation Liaison Service (PCLS) and Neuropsychology Consultation Service are teams that provide multidisciplinary clinical services to patients enrolled in clinical protocols at the NIH CC. In 2017, the Neurodevelopmental and Behavioral Phenotyping Service (see ZIC-MH002961-05) and the Sleep and Neurodevelopment Service (see ZIC-MH002962-05) were added. See OCD Psychiatry Consultation Liaison Service Research ZIA-MH002922-13 for additional details. MENTAL HEALTH RESPONSE TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC:The NIMH Clinical Director co-Chaired with NIH OD, the Trans-NIH Mental Health Response Team responsible for providing mental health education, guidance and resources via posters, videos, websites, and more than 40 webinars at IC Town Halls and All Hands Meetings, as all NIH staff adapted to maximum telework and concurrent historical events. HERE 2 LISTEN - Staff Support Line: In the wake of the COVID pandemic, the NIMH OCD team, working in collaboration with the NIH Employee Assistance Program, spearheaded an NIH-wide Staff Support Line to give staff a place to relieve stress during the pandemic. Staffed by NIMH mental health clinicians and staff from May 2020 to May 2021, the telephone support line was available to any NIH employee, trainee or contractor from Monday through Friday, 9-12pm and 1-4pm, and received over 100 calls.The MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS AND RECRUITMENT UNIT (MCRU) facilitates comprehensive, creative and diverse NIMH patient recruitment through design and materials development, targeted marketing and advertising planning, and community outreach. In FY2021, our Community Outreach Program reached over 200,000 individuals through 96 meetings with providers, consumers, community members, 34 scientific seminars, and electronic mailings.

The NIMH OCD contributes to NIMH national initiatives to identify and promote academic research careers among early career psychiatrists. In addition, the OCD organizes scientific programs that educate psychiatrists about cutting edge research on serious mental illness and clinical neuroscience.PGY4 Psychiatry Residency and Clinical Fellowship ProgramsSince 1954, the NIMH IRP has supported training programs considered to be a national resource for physicians seeking intensive research training in psychiatry and clinical neuroscience. There are two programs offered, both of which are full-time three-year positions. One is a post-residency clinical fellowship for highly motivated and qualified MD and MD-PhDs; and the other is an Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) accredited fourth post-graduate year (PGY4) residency program for current psychiatry residents who go on to become clinical fellows. The NIMH residency program is a unique one-year program that provides nearly full-time research training while at the same time fulfilling the ACGME requirements of the fourth year of residency. Psychiatry residents who transfer to the program have completed all required clinical rotations prior to coming to NIMH. Residents and fellows are recruited nationally from many of the top psychiatry residency programs in the United States. The residency and fellowship programs select trainees with excellent clinical psychiatry skills, strong research backgrounds, and commitment to a research career.The research training programs are mentorship driven and individually tailored. Skills are developed through close interactions with mentors and hands on research experiences. Residents and fellows join specialty research groups that study mechanisms or treatments of major mental illnesses in adults and children. Emphasis in these programs is on psychopharmacology; novel therapeutics including pharmacologic and psychotherapy trials and neuromodulation; behavioral endocrinology; neurobiology; neurodevelopment; neurogenetics; psychiatric epidemiology; functional, structural and molecular brain imaging; sleep, autoimmune brain disorders and computational neuroscience/psychiatry methodologies. Each fellow/resident writes an Individualized Development Plan that defines their specific goals and activities.","Clinical Fellowship Programs:During FY21, there were seven NIMH IRP residents/fellows. The academic year generally starts in July so this number can include new, current and departing trainees from our programs. Of the seven trainees, four entered through the PGY-4 ACGME accredited psychiatry residency program. We added two new PGY-4 trainees in FY21. In FY2020, several clinical fellows transitioned to new positions in industry, academia and continued post-doctoral training.Some resident/fellow members as well as trainees and staff in the NIMH OCD collaborated with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) on a longitudinal study of COVID-19 survivors and controls, A Longitudinal Study of COVID-19 Sequelae and Immunity, Laboratory of Immunoregulation, NIAID/NIH. PI  Michael Sneller (P205068). Several residents/fellows participated in other online COVID-19 online studies with their Principal Investigators that were rapidly initiated in Spring 2020.
