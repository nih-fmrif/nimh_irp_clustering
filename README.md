# nimh_irp_clustering

This repo contains the code for an analysis of collaborations within the NIMH IRP based on collaborators reported in investigator's annual reports available from https://nidb.nih.gov. This analysis was requested from the Scientific Director's office (Jenny Mehren) and originally conducted by Dylan Nielson in 2019. A follow up analysis is being conducted for 2022.
